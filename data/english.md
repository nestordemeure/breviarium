# Breviarum Politicorum

## A Word from the Publisher

Occupied with most weighty affairs, I had put off printing this Political Treatise which an Italian Prince had sent me to publish, but now on command of the same Most Excellent Prince I make it public. The dignity of the subject, and the name of the Most Eminent Cardinal Mazarin, to whose manner and rule of life have been arranged and composed the things set forth here especially, will add no small weight to the political rules which are commonly proposed. For how submerged he was in most grievous storms, and all but overwhelmed, escapes no one.

But by what arts he overcame by swimming those various billows of adverse fortune, by which he seemed bound to be swallowed up, and arrived most prosperously at the port of safety, is not so obvious for anyone to gather; what greatest arts he applied in those most dangerous and difficult times in the administration of a most powerful Kingdom, drawn apart by various factions; and how he emerged with glory from very many and varied difficulties and, what is of no small import for his glory, imbued, before he took the helm, the mind of *Louis XIV*, easily the Greatest of all the Kings of France, with those precepts of ruling by which, grasping the reins of the Kingdom, he expanded the limits of France far and wide, and raised it to the highest pinnacle of dignity and power—this is difficult to excerpt, but this Treatise will relieve you of this burden.

And since there scarcely exists a properly shaped and wholly complete system of Political precepts, since the particular circumstances which greatly vary general rules are infinite, therefore no simpler or happier method can be handed down than if, applying those general rules to those particular circumstances on which they depend, we render a discipline propped up only with general precepts practical or active from theoretical.

But you will more easily achieve this object, (kind Reader,) if you endeavor to observe with your own eyes this illustrious example, to whose pattern, as it were, of a political leader and standard-bearer today's Politicians strive to adapt themselves and accommodate their rules of prudence: yet I would have you so conduct yourself that you may indeed have a clear view of the principles and norms which Political men are accustomed to use, not however that you may deceive, but that you may not be deceived, joining both these norms of highest prudence, which both that general rule of equity and justice, and the Gospel precept prescribe:

> *What you would not have done to yourself, do not do to another; Be wise as Serpents, and simple as Doves.*

The Art, moreover, of Winning Hearts which we have added—from all sides blameless, and derived from the clearest springs by a most celebrated Artist of political doctrine—carries every point.

Enjoy this labor of ours, and Farewell.

## Fundamentals

There were once two fundamentals in sincere Philosophy, as there are two now. In the past, now: *Endure and Abstain* then, now *Simulate and Dissimulate*, or *Know Yourself*, *Know Others*, which (unless I am mistaken) also support the former.
Therefore, we will undertake these first; then we will address the former in various *human Actions*, and since these occur almost without order, we will present them without regarding order.

### Learn About Yourself

Are you laboring under anger, fear, recklessness, or some other passion?

Consider what defects mark you in morals, at the table, in the temple, in conversing, playing, in other actions, especially social ones?

Examine all the parts of the body: whether the eyes are too insolent, the foot or head too much inclined, there are wrinkles in the forehead, or the ends of the lips are unclean; whether the gait is too slow or too fast?

With whom do you deal, whether they are praiseworthy men, fortunate, prudent?

At what time do you become most incautious, whether you fall in word or manner? Whether at the table when you are drunk? Whether in games, or in calamity? Where, according to Tacitus, *The minds of mortals are soft*.

What places do you frequent, whether suspect, vile, infamous, unworthy of you?

Beware in your actions, lest there be a lack of caution, to which the reading of this little book is useful, in what place, time, in what dignity, and with a person of what dignity do you act?

Note down individual defects, so that in these matters your mind may more strictly attend to you.

It will be of use, as often as it may happen that you lapse, to enjoin something harder on yourself.

If you are offended to the point of an outpouring of bile, say nothing, nor show anger by any sign, provided that you are in such circumstances, where you can show your zeal in vain, nor satisfy yourself, but simulate, that you are by no means injured, and await a more opportune hour.

Show nothing in your countenance except humanity, or even affection.

Do not easily laugh at any jest.

Strive to have all men thoroughly understood by you.

Never betray your secrets to anyone; fish out those of others.

Speak or do nothing unbecoming before anyone, even if it is natural, and not malicious, because such things others despise.

With a firm gait preserve modesty, otherwise observe all things with keen eyes, and finish your curiosity with a prudent brow.

Such men are held to be prudent, astute, and accurate.

### Learn About Others

Much is learned through sickness, drunkenness, cups, wallets, where profit or loss is concerned, in games, and in travel, where with the doors of the soul left open, beasts more readily leave their lairs.

In affliction, especially unjust, etc.

These occasions are to be observed, and one should deal with those whom one wishes to know.

It helps much to frequent his friends, sons, boys, intimates, servants, who can be easily corrupted by small gifts, and betray much. What you suspect another to be thinking, introduce the opposite of this in conversation by praising it: if he thinks the opposite, he will hardly be so cautious as not to betray himself by defending it, or adding something to show he feels the opposite.

What vices someone is laboring under, you will learn by this art: bring up in conversation those vices which occur most frequently, and which the friend is most likely to be laboring under; the one he is laboring under, he will attack and abominate most bitterly.

Thus preachers usually labor under those vices which they accuse most ardently. Ask advice about something; after a few days deal with the same person, for by God's providence we easily forget lies.

Pretend you have some knowledge of something, and in the presence of him whom you think knows, relate it; he, by correcting you, will betray his knowledge. See with whom someone associates, for a man is known by his associates, etc.

Praise someone, or console them in affliction, because in these cases obscure and hidden thoughts burst forth.

Entice someone to tell the story of his life (which can be done if you tell yours while pretending); what wickedness he has inflicted on another will give you grounds to argue about the present; but be cautious not to betray your own. You will explore knowledge thus: e.g. give an epigram to be read; if he praises it too much, and it is poor, he is a meager poet; if he praises it insofar as it is praiseworthy, he is a poet. Likewise, bring up food in conversation, you will recognize a glutton; the same is true of other vices and virtues. Have him propose in company, as if in jest, to offer judgment on some matter, what each one is capable of, what virtues he has, to what office he is equal; for often jests contain much truth. You will also sometimes be able to act as a physician, mixing such things into food that will make them cheerful and talkative, etc. It is a sign of a malicious man, who frequently contradicts; such a one often descends to theft.

Those who boast much of themselves are not much to be feared. They are fantastical, who are scrupulous, sad, of much vocal prayer, who have nails that are too short, who do external mortifications without internal ones.

You will recognize one elevated from begging, if he begins to complain about food and clothing; for elevated beggars affect such things more than the noble, though they do so before the noble.

Those given to wine and Venus hardly keep a secret, because these are slaves of the mistress, and are carried away by the inconsiderateness of the tongue.

You will catch a false and boastful man thus: while he is enumerating his journeys, wanderings, military campaigns, deeds, so many years spent in this place.

Then take the sum of all, ask on another occasion what year he began this, what year he ended it.

How many years he has lived; a great discrepancy will be evident. Likewise, ask how many towers that city has, or a most celebrated citadel, whose name you invent, whether he knows it; or, as if knowing all things, congratulate him that he escaped this or that danger. You will recognize an upright man and his piety, if in his life concord is observed, if ambition and appetite for a higher place are absent; let not modesty be affected, and in all things a composition, let not effeminate speech or excessive external mortification be shown, by drinking or eating too little, etc.

Melancholics or phlegmatics are by nature those who boast most of being averse to ambition and pride, and who, when offended, immediately act in a friendly manner.

Those who have an affected gentleness, a hill on the nose, and keen eyes, are usually astute. Let advice be sought from someone; his prudence, dexterity, etc. will be recognized.

Hence also a doubtful and ambiguous mind must also be feigned.

He who readily promises, trust him little, for he is false and deceitful.

Judge as tenacious of a secret, one who through no friendship reveals another's secrets to you; and so bribe such a one to entrust something to him, or to seek from him what has been entrusted to you; but they are more prone to reveal to women, boys, loved ones, and those whom each one loves as greater and superior to himself; if he reveals another's secret to you, entrust nothing to him, for he may have one whom he loves as much as you.

It will help sometimes to intercept, re-read, and respond to the letters of one's subjects.

Those who have too many peculiar and elegant things are effeminate and usually not very holy.

Those who have weapons that are too elegant are usually poor soldiers; those whose instruments of art are too refined are poor artisans, unless youth excuses it.

Likewise, those who indulge their own nature too much, and who are too good-looking and amiable, are not very learned.

You will catch a flatterer thus: pretend you have done something that is clearly absurd, and report it boastfully; if he praises it, he is a flatterer; otherwise, if he at least keeps silent.

You will notice a false friend if a third person, instructed by you, announces to him that you have been reduced to extremes, that the rights on which you relied have been found to be false; if he should hear it as if not caring, he will never be a friend.

Also send someone to seek advice from him in your name, and at the same time aid; you will notice what kind he is, and when his virtue is proven, pretend that everything was falsely reported to you. The unlearned betray themselves by too much elegance in their things, by adornment of walls, care for their bed, or if something less than Latin is uttered, they laugh and show that they notice it.

Beware of men of small stature; for they are obstinate, factious, etc.

The concord of friends you will explore thus: in the presence of another, vituperate one of them by name; praise them then, either from silence or from a frigid response you will notice the whole matter. Propose in company some cases, how one might proceed ingeniously in this or that case; from each one's response his intelligence and cunning will be evident. Likewise propose how such and such people might be deceived; bring up the topic of persecutions.

He who says he has suffered the most will prove it by saying the most.

Liars are usually by nature those who, when they laugh, have little pits in their cheeks. From those who take too much care of their own skin, fear little.

From young people and those who are too old, much is learned in any business.

A simulator is one who speaks both well and ill of the same thing; for this an occasion must be given to him.

Those who know many languages are often of little judgment, because much memory is wont to hinder judgment. If someone suddenly exhibits great virtues, who had otherwise been vicious, hold him suspect. Whom you think will betray what you say, speak some singular things in his presence, and such as you have said in the presence of no other; if what is said is betrayed, you have the informer. If others tell their dreams, ask the frequent dreamer different things, and by reasoning together you will learn much of his secret mind.

As if someone says he loves you, fish out at another time his dreams; if he never dreams of you, his love is feigned.

Explore another's mind toward you by showing your pursuits, or by pretending to be his enemy.

Show knowledge of no one's sin, nor tell the faults of others with blame or too much zeal; you will be judged to labor under the same.

If an accuser comes to you to betray another, pretend you have already heard it, and many other things; then you will see that he will add suspicions and particulars which he would not otherwise have said.

Those who act too tenderly with dogs and pleasant boys are soft.

Those who speak with a feigned voice and feigned cough are effeminate, prone to lust; likewise those who are too well-groomed, adorned, desiring to please the eyes of others, and too observant of a younger or more feminine age.

False are those who announce all things too easily, who approve all your things too much, for this friendship is feigned. He who inveighs too sharply against others in your presence is to be guarded against, for he will do the same to you.

Catch one tenacious of a secret thus: tell him something under strictest secrecy; tell the same to another with the same caution; send a third, conscious of the fraud, to call these two together and insinuate something about what was entrusted in conversation; here it will appear what each one will betray, and who will betray it first; if they realize that all three of them know something together, he who does not then betray it, make him your secretary.

To learn another's mind, bribe someone whom he loves, and through him you will learn the most secret things.
