# Breviarum Politicorum

## A Word from the Publisher

I had been delaying the publication of this Political treatise, sent to me by an Italian Prince, due to being overwhelmed with the most pressing matters. Now, under the orders of that same Excellent Prince, I am making it public. The importance of the subject, and the name of Cardinal Mazarin, whose life serves as the model and standard for the ideas presented here, will add significant weight to the commonly proposed political rules. Everyone is aware of the serious storms the Eminent Prince faced and nearly succumbed to.

However, it is not so obvious to everyone the skills he used to overcome those various tides of misfortune, which seemed certain to overwhelm him, and how he navigated through them to reach a safe harbor. He achieved great things in managing a powerful Kingdom torn apart by factions during those dangerous and challenging times, and emerged from numerous difficulties with increased glory. Notably, he instilled in the mind of *Louis XIV*, easily the greatest of all French Kings, the principles of ruling that allowed him to vastly expand France's borders and raise it to the height of dignity and power upon taking the throne. Extracting these lessons is difficult, but this Treatise will spare you that task.

As there is hardly any complete and perfected system of Political precepts, since the particular circumstances that greatly vary the general rules are infinite, no simpler or more fortunate method can be provided than to make the discipline, supported only by general precepts, practical or active by adapting those general rules to the particular circumstances on which they depend.

But you will more easily achieve that goal, dear Reader, if you strive to keep this illustrious example before your eyes, according to whose model today's Politicians attempt to conform and adapt their rules using their own wisdom. However, I wish for you to conduct yourself in a way that allows you to clearly understand the reasoning and norms that Political men typically use, not to deceive others, but to avoid being deceived yourself, by combining the two norms of the highest prudence prescribed by the general rule of fairness and justice, and the teaching of the Gospel:

> *Do not do to others what you would not want done to you, Be wise as Serpents, and innocent as Doves.*

Enjoy this work of ours, and farewell.

## Fundamentals

There were once two fundamental principles in sincere Philosophy: *Sustain and Abstain*. Now, new principles prevail: *Simulate and Dissimulate*, or *Learn About Yourself* and *Learn About Others*, which (if I am not mistaken) also reinforce the former.

We will first address *Learn About Yourself* and *Learn About Others*. Then, since human *Actions* generally occur without any set order, we will explore *Simulate and Dissimulate* in various contexts, without adhering to any particular sequence.

### Learn About Yourself

Are you overcome by anger, fear, rashness, or some other passion? What defects are evident in your conduct, at the table, in church, in conversation, in games, along with other actions, especially social ones?

Examine all the parts of your body: is your eye too insolent, foot or head bent too far, forehead wrinkled, lips unkempt, gait too slow or fast?

With whom do you associate - are they praiseworthy, fortunate, prudent people?

At what times are you rendered most incautious - do you stumble in word or deed? At the table when you are drunk? In games, or in calamity? For according to Tacitus, "the minds of mortals are pliable" at such times.

What places do you visit - are they suspect, vile, disreputable, unworthy of you? Be cautious in your actions, and never let caution be absent - to which end reading this little book will serve. In what place, at what time, in what station, and with a person of what rank are you interacting?

Mark down each individual defect, so that you may attend to it all the more strictly. It will be beneficial, whenever it happens that you slip up, to impose something rather harsh on yourself.
If you are provoked to the point of an outpouring of bile, say nothing, and show no sign of anger, provided you are in such circumstances where you can show your zeal to no purpose, and cannot satisfy yourself; but *pretend* that you are not injured in the least, and await a more opportune hour.

Show nothing in your face except kindness, or even affection. Do not readily laugh at just any witticism.

Strive to have everyone figured out. Never reveal your secrets to anyone; fish for the secrets of others.

Say or do nothing indecorous in the presence of anyone, even if it is natural and not malicious, because such things are despised by others.

Preserve modesty with a steady gait, but otherwise keenly observe everything with sharp eyes and a wise brow to give the appearance of curiosity. Such people are considered prudent, astute, and precise.

### Learn About Others

Much can be learned about someone in sickness, drunkenness, when money is involved and gain or loss is at stake, in games and while traveling - when the doors of the mind are relaxed, the wild beasts more readily emerge from their dens. Also in times of affliction, especially when insulted, etc. These occasions should be observed; in these situations one should interact with those one wishes to know.

It helps greatly to frequent someone's friends, children, young servants, and attendants, who can easily be bribed with small gifts to reveal much.

If you suspect what the other person is thinking, suggest the opposite in conversation, praising it. If he thinks the contrary, he will scarcely be so cautious as to not betray himself by defending it or adding something to show he feels otherwise.

You will recognize what vices someone struggles with by this art: bring up in conversation the vices that most commonly occur and with which your friend is most likely to struggle; he will most fiercely attack and curse the vice with which he himself struggles. Thus, preachers are often prone to the very vices they most ardently denounce.

Ask for advice on some matter; after a few days, discuss it with the same person, for by God's providence we easily forget lies.

Pretend you have knowledge of some matter and mention it in front of the person you think knows about it; he will reveal his own knowledge by correcting you.

See with whom a person associates, for a man is known by the company he keeps, etc.

Praise someone or console them in affliction, because in such cases obscure and hidden thoughts burst forth.

Entice someone to tell their life story (which can be done by telling your own, pretending); what wicked deeds they have done to others - from this you will have grounds to reason about the present. But be cautious not to reveal your own.

You will test knowledge in this way, e.g. give an epigram to be read; if he praises it excessively and it is actually poor, he is a man of little poetic ability. If he praises it insofar as it is praiseworthy, he is a poet. Likewise bring up the subject of food and you will recognize a glutton. The same holds for other vices and virtues.

Have someone propose at a gathering, as if in jest, what each person's abilities are, what virtues they have, what office they are suited for - for often jests weave much truth.

You can also sometimes play the doctor, mixing things into the food that will make them cheerful and talkative, etc.

It is a sign of a malicious man to frequently contradict; one who often stoops to theft is like this.

Those who boast much about themselves are not greatly to be feared; they are fantasizers.

Those who are scrupulous, gloomy, say many vocal prayers, have excessively short fingernails, and practice external mortifications without internal ones are also fantasizers.

You will recognize one raised from poverty if he starts to complain about food and clothing, for the poor, when elevated, especially desire such things above the nobility.

Those devoted to wine and Venus rarely keep secrets. The later are slaves to their mistress; the former are carried away to inconsiderate speech when inebriated.

You will catch out a braggart and boaster in this way: while he is enumerating his journeys, travels, military service, exploits, how many years he spent in this or that place - then add up the total of all the years; on another occasion ask him what year he began this, what year he finished. How many years his life spans - a great inconsistency will be evident. Also ask if he knows how many towers that famous city has, or that most celebrated fortress (make up a name) - or congratulate him, as if knowing everything, that he escaped this or that danger.

You will recognize an upright man and his piety if consistency is observed in his life; if ambition and the desire for a higher position are absent; if his modesty is not affected and his composure in all things is not contrived; if his speech is not effeminate and excessive outward mortification is not displayed by drinking or eating too little, etc.

Those who most boast of being free from ambition and pride, and who act in an overly friendly manner when offended, are by nature melancholic or phlegmatic. Those who have an affected gentleness, a little bump on the nose, and sharp eyes are usually cunning.

Ask for advice from someone and his prudence, skill, etc. will be recognized. Hence one should also pretend to be of two minds and uncertain.

Put little trust in one who promises easily, for he is a liar and deceiver.

Judge someone to be a keeper of secrets if he never reveals the secrets of another to you out of any friendship - and so suborn such a person to entrust something to him, or to seek from him what you have entrusted: but they are more apt to disclose things to women, children, their beloved, and those they love as superior to themselves. If he reveals someone else's secret to you, entrust him with nothing, because he may have someone he loves as much as you.

It will sometimes be helpful to intercept, read and resend the letters of one's subjects.

Those who have too many particular and elegant possessions are effeminate and often not very holy. Those who have excessively ornate weapons are often poor soldiers; those with overly refined tools of their trade are often poor craftsmen, unless youth excuses it. Likewise, those who indulge their own nature too much and are excessively handsome and likeable are often unlearned.

You will detect a flatterer in this way: pretend you have done something that is clearly absurd and boast about it. If he praises it, he is a flatterer; if not, if at least he remains silent.

You will notice a false friend if a third party, instructed by you, reports to him that you have been reduced to the utmost extremity, that the laws on which you relied have been found to be false; if he hears this as if unconcerned, he will never be a friend. Also send someone to seek advice from him in your name and at the same time ask for help; you will see what kind of person he is. And having tested his proven virtue, pretend that everything was falsely reported to you.

The uneducated betray themselves by excessive elegance in their possessions, by the decoration of their walls, by their fastidiousness about their bed, or if something is said that is less than pure Latin, they laugh and show they noticed it.

Beware of men of small stature; they are obstinate, factious, etc.

You will test the harmony between friends in this way: disparage one of them by name in front of the other; then praise him - from the silence or lukewarm response you will discern the whole matter.

Propose some cases in a group setting, how one could proceed ingeniously in this or that situation; each person's cleverness and cunning will be evident from their response. Also suggest how this or that person could be deceived; bring up the subject of persecutions. He who says the most will prove he has suffered the most.

Liars are often by nature those who have dimples in their cheeks when they laugh.

Do not greatly fear those who are excessively concerned with their own skin.

Much can be learned about any matter from the young and the very old.

One who speaks both well and ill of the same matter is a dissembler - an occasion should be given for this.

Those who know many languages are often of poor judgment, because an excess of memory often hinders judgment.

If someone suddenly displays great virtues, having previously been wicked, be suspicious.

If you think someone will betray your words, speak some unique things in front of him, things you have said in front of no one else; if the saying is spread, you have found the informer.

If others tell you their dreams, ask the frequent dreamer about different dreams, and after some discussion you will learn much about his secret mind. For example, if someone says he loves you, on another occasion fish for dreams; if he never dreams of you, his love is feigned.

Explore another's feelings toward you by showing your efforts, or by pretending to be his enemy.

Show no knowledge of any vice, and do not relate the vices of others with censure or excessive zeal, or you will be judged to labor under the same ones.

If an accuser comes to you, intending to betray another, pretend you have already heard it, and many other things besides; then you will see what suspicions and particulars he will add that he would not otherwise have said.

Those who act too tenderly with dogs and pleasant children are soft. Those who speak with a fake voice and a fake cough are effeminate, prone to lust; so too are those who are excessively well-groomed, adorned, desiring to please the eyes of others, and too observant of a younger or more feminine age.

Deceivers are those who concede everything too easily, who excessively approve of all your actions, because this friendship is feigned.

Beware of associating with one who inveighs too fiercely against others in your presence, because he will do the same to you.

Catch a keeper of secrets in this way: tell him something under the strictest secrecy; tell the same thing to another with the same caution; set up a third party, aware of the deception, to convene these two and insinuate something about what was entrusted. Here it will appear what each one will betray, and who will betray it first. If they realize all three of them know something together, the one who does not betray it then - make him your secretary.

To learn another's mind, suborn someone whom he loves, and through them you will discover his most secret thoughts.

## Acting in Society

As I begin this part of the discussion, I follow no set order, exploring various contexts.

### Gaining Favor from a Friend

Determine what matters your friend cares about and tailor your gifts to his interests. Suitable items include mathematics books, optical instruments, microscopes, sundials, various mirrors, and other curiosities, as well as treatises on the secrets of nature, of which *Mizauld* offers many.

Speak with him often, consult him, and ask for his advice, then follow it. But never lay yourself so bare that if he becomes your enemy, he can use it against you.

Ask nothing of him that would be difficult to grant, especially where it touches upon issues of property or money.

Congratulate him briefly but elegantly on feast days, birthdays, good health, etc.

Rarely mention his virtues but always overlook his vices.

Share your travels with him, relate praises others have spoken of him, and whisper everything in his ear, especially things said by his superiors.

Never reveal his faults or vices, no matter how much he may ask. If he urges you, lest you seem distrustful, relate at most the mildest faults, or those he has openly acknowledged himself. For such things leave a bitter memory, no matter how they are said, especially if there is too much truth in them.

Send him frequent greetings through others and in your own letters.

Never defend an opinion contrary to his, or if you have dared to differ, allow him to persuade you. Show that you have been swayed and conceal that you disagreed.

Be liberal in giving him titles and eagerly offer services you will never need to fulfill.

Do not seek to please anyone through their vices, or even through qualities that conflict with your status. If you are a clergyman, avoid excessive jesting, scurrility, deep drinking, etc. While these may win affection in the moment, they will eventually lead to contempt, ridicule, or even fierce hatred, though it may not arise immediately. Therefore, even if at times it may be expedient to stray beyond the bounds of virtue, let it be done without vice.

When you arrive somewhere new, first understand who enjoys favor with the master of the place, who has influence through faction and eloquence. Win their favor by any means, so that you may use their advice and influence in promoting matters, for such people will take some of the responsibility upon themselves when they give counsel.

If you wish to take revenge on someone, make him appear suspect to them and turn their envy to your cause.

Never commit any crime at your master's behest, for even if you win his gratitude in the moment, he will thereafter view you as a critic, able to do to your master what you readily undertook at his command, a man of faith and virtue for sale. At least part from the reward for the deed as soon as it was done.

Write some letters praising a third party and allow them to be lost and intercepted so they reach that third party.

Many judge that what pleases them will also please others; therefore they act accordingly. You should instead prudently explore what is pleasing or displeasing to the other person.

Address even your inferiors as brothers and preempt them with honors, provided they are of good character.

Never provide pleasing things to the point of satiety, lest you induce nausea. Leave them wanting more, whether in games, conversation, etc.

Never borrow from a friend, for if he cannot grant what you ask, it is offensive, and he will hate you; or if he reluctantly agrees, or receives back less than whole, he will resent it.

Never buy from a friend, for if he sells dearly, you will be harmed; if cheaply, he will be.

Treat even his lowliest servants well, otherwise they will gradually turn your friend's mind against you.

Observe this at banquets: entrust them with pretended secrets, even some that pertain to their office, show that you hold them in a special position.

If you deal familiarly with servants, they will hold you in contempt; if angrily, they will hate you; but with gentle gravity, they will revere you.

With free men, show benevolence, love, and courtesy. Do not allow them to stoop to humble services or extreme gestures of submission, such as kissing feet. Consider the greedy to be on the same level as slaves in terms of their disposition.

If you seek the favor of the people, promise to promote their interests, especially those that benefit individuals, for they are moved more by these than by honor.

If invited to dine with inferiors, accept, find no fault in anything, surpass them all in civility while preserving your dignity, and at least be liberal in your words. Take care not to take or appropriate anything of theirs against their will.

Frequently show compassion, console, and bestow favors in stages.

Despise nothing, but rather praise.

If you must contradict, do not accuse them of imprudence or ignorance, but rather, having praised their reasoning and good intentions, point out the disadvantages and costs that would follow.

Always show yourself a champion of the people's freedoms.

Observe the friend whose favor you wish to gain - is he given to arms or to learning, to clemency or to ferocity?

Rarely act as an intercessor, for whatever is done for others on your account is taken from you, and your favor will not remain intact. Keep the ruler wholly for yourself.

Reveal no one's secrets to another, for you will then be of little worth to him.

If he commands you to commit a crime, delay, and think of a way to excuse yourself. Feign illness, stolen horses, etc.

First win over the servants of one whose friendship you seek, even bribing them with gold if necessary; they will draw over their master as well.

However far you advance in his favor, treat it no differently than if you were still seeking it through a thousand kindnesses: for favor, once acquired, wishes to be maintained so as not to be lost; indeed, it requires to be nourished by attentions.

### Knowing Who is Someone's Friend

Praise someone; if the other person remains silent, they will not be a friend. You can also tell that they are not a friend if they divert the conversation elsewhere, speak halfheartedly or reluctantly, diminish the praise, claim the story is inconsistent, or attribute part of the praise to others. Moreover, if they are aware of a praiseworthy deed but fail to add anything to what you say that could enhance it, they are not a true friend.

Additionally, if they dismiss it as a chance occurrence, attribute it to God's extraordinary providence, claim that others have accomplished equal or greater feats, or suggest that it was achieved through the counsel of another, they are not a genuine friend.

Forge letters in a friend's name to him, in which you ask for something to be entrusted - his disposition, favorable or otherwise, will be evident.

Greet him in a friend's name, or say you heard ill of him, and see what he will add to these things.

### Gaining Esteem and Reputation

Never be certain that someone will keep a secret if you act or speak too freely or confidently in their presence, not even a child or servant. Instead, they will judge you by this action and describe you as such to others.

Never assume that someone will excuse your questionable action. In fact, they will interpret it in the worst light. Therefore, do not allow yourself anything, even with only one witness.

Do not relate how you were previously defamed or wronged, for you will only defame yourself further and there will be those who approve.

The saying of Bernard does not apply here: "Excuse the intention if you cannot excuse the deed", so that they may say you sinned by accident or thoughtlessly, or that you solicited evil to test them.

At times, especially with talkative people, confidently entrust a secret and ask that they not reveal it to others, namely that you have great influence with the powerful, have correspondence with others, etc. Then, avoiding being seen by others, write letters to such powerful people, seal them, and show that you are then burning the replies which you, however, carelessly keep.

What some hear only partially, they also distort. Thus, if anything like this happens, it must be read carefully.

Boast that you have never harmed anyone.

If you have helped someone, especially in front of this person, say that you expect a crown from God for your good deeds. You can give examples invented on the spot to support your claim.

Whatever is to be made public (even if it is the smallest thing), do it as perfectly as possible, because often an eternal opinion depends on a single act.

Never take on many things at once, because there is no glory in doing many things, only in perfecting one thing. I attest this from experience.

It is always proper and useful to yield to the angry, the powerful, and relatives. Feign humility of mind, candor, generosity, and cheerfulness. Praise, give thanks, and readily offer yourself, even to the undeserving.

The beginnings of things should be done with the highest counsel and labor, and with all certainty of success. As the first things go, so go all things, and fame once gained will coalesce errors themselves into glory.

If there is something you are obligated to do by your office, do not take it on at anyone's request, as it will diminish your intention toward the work you owe. Be certain that respect will be diminished, however much you have done and however many cares distracted you, if you are even slightly lacking in your duty, or even by the very fact that you took them on.

If you are going to negotiate affairs, do not admit a partner who is suitable and more practiced in them than you. If you are going to approach someone, do not have with you one who is more acceptable. If you are going to change office, do not allow notably better successors.

Have honors to your House be committed to print, disregarding any accompanying criticism. Whatever is written with truth and dedication will one day be read as plausible, while words fade with or before the speaker.

You will establish a reputation for knowledge in this way: From historical sciences, whatever you can obtain, put in one little book, and when you have leisure each month, reread it. Thus you will imprint the appearances of all things, and when necessary, you will show knowledge.

Have many prepared formulas for responding, greeting, speaking, and whatever must be done suddenly.

Some individuals debase themselves too much in order to be praised, or so that they may seem to be carried by fortune rather than worries; by natural talent instead of effort. They begin to neglect and despise themselves, often convincing others to regard them as lazy and feeble. You should allow those committed to religious life to behave in this manner.

Never act to the full extent of your power, so that you may be believed to be unable to do anything more.

What you can do, correct, or punish through servants, do not do yourself. You do the greater things.

Do not dispute uncertain things, unless you know you will certainly win.

If you arrange a banquet, share your fortune with the servants of the guests. This is a talkative crowd with significant influence in spreading a bad reputation. A generous gesture should captivate their attention, preventing them from prying into other matters. Similarly, deal generously with the barber and the prostitute.

### Finding More Time for Business

Delegate minor tasks to others.

Prescribe for yourself an exact order, which you should never transgress. Allot the smallest parts of time to the smallest matters, and do not linger on any task longer than necessary to complete it properly.

If you are fatigued by work, do not undertake anything further, but refresh yourself with honest play and physical activity. Afterwards, you will accomplish more, and more easily, in a short time. Or at least take on a task that you can handle without effort.

Tasks that must be drawn out over several days are best separated, so that you may dispatch them. Do not take on tasks that yield little profit or glory, yet require much labor. For the sake of no one should you engage in useless tasks that demand much time.

Do not deal personally with craftsmen, manage household affairs, gardens, or buildings. These tasks are full of labors and give rise to one concern after another.

### Acquiring Gravity

Undertake suitable occupations, such as not handling weapons if you are a Prelate; not practicing chiromancy if you are a Nobleman; not practicing Medicine if you are Religious; and not being a fencing-master if you are a Priest.

Do not easily make promises or concessions.

Do not easily laugh or quickly conclude matters.

Do not change what has been decided.

Do not fix your eyes on another.

Do not toss your nose or wrinkle your forehead.

Do not be sullen.

Make few gestures.

Keep your head erect.

Use few and sententious words.

Do not take excessively wide steps. Compose all of your limbs with decorum.

Do not admit to anyone that you love, hate, or fear anything.

Do not personally handle base matters, but through servants, and do not speak of them.

Let no one be present when you are at the table, going to bed, or getting up.

Have few friends and deal with them rarely, lest you be held in contempt.

Do not engage in conversation indiscriminately in any place.

Do not suddenly change your habits, even for the better, nor your dress, your way of living, your splendor, etc.

In praise and blame, one should abstain from excessive exaggerations, but judge in proportion to the matter, lest you become grave through hyperbole.

Rarely let your excessive affections, such as delights, admirations, etc., manifest.

Display piety even in the most intimate friendship.

Likewise, when you act with the greatest confidence, do not complain about anyone or accuse anyone.

Do not command your subordinates to do many things at once and things they cannot carry out, because they will learn to despise commands or will be able to show they were imprudently ordered.

Make no laws, or very few.

Do not be quick to anger, for if you are then quick to be appeased, you will be considered fickle.

If you are going to say something publicly, meditate beforehand, and speak from a written text.

### Reading and Writing

If you are writing in a place that many people frequent, raise up the written paper as if you were copying it. Let this be visible to everyone, while what you are truly writing lies hidden, covered in such a way that only the line you have copied is visible and can be read by anyone approaching. Cover what you have written in a book or another sheet of paper, or move the raised paper closer.

If someone approaches while you are reading, immediately turn many pages so your focus is not detected. In fact, it is best to have several books combined, so that one may be presented for inspection before another.

If you are writing letters or reading a book and someone arrives in whose presence reading would make you suspect, foresee this and propose something completely different from the book and letters, as if reading from them. For example, if you are writing warnings, ask the approaching guest what you could cautiously and prudently respond to such a case, or ask for news so you could fill the letters. Do the same when counting money or reading a book.

Write secrets in your own hand; unless you are writing in ciphers that can be read and understood by everyone, like those Trithemius gave in his *Polygraphia*, these conceal more if written by another's hand. Ciphers that cannot be read arouse suspicion and interception, unless you write skillfully.

### Giving Gifts and Favors

Be generous in giving what you know others will not ask for, or what they will never use, such as privileges.

A teacher should not instruct his student so thoroughly that the student no longer hopes to learn more. Nor should a parent give so much to his child that the child either does not need any favors or cannot hope for anything more. The same applies to a master with respect to his servant.
If lands are given, they should be of a kind that require the master's goodwill, for instance lacking wood, water, or mills.
If a contract or deed is drawn up, a clause should be included making it revocable at the master's discretion.

If someone is worthy of a common office and declines it when you confer it on him, do not allow him to refuse under any circumstances; unless it is publicly known that he has done this. Otherwise, it will be believed that you did not adequately compensate his merits.
So that he cannot excuse himself, confer it when it must be immediately administered, and meanwhile be absent, so that he is compelled to inquire about the appointment and begin his duties in the meantime.

A favor should be granted in such a way that you lose nothing by it, for instance by forgiving due penalties as a reward, or new taxes that you would otherwise have imposed less justly, following the example of your neighbors.
The things you use yourself, such as weapons, horses, rings, should not be too costly, so that you can give them away as a great gift at little cost to yourself.

When giving gifts, avoid common methods. For instance, to give a rifle, have a contest with a prize for hitting a target, then give it to the winner as if already victorious. You can certainly decide on the matter, or rig the game.

If you wish to give something pleasing to a particular person, do not promise it, because then they will decline it politely, or at least buy it with entreaties.

Those who praise their own possessions in front of others are inviting them to ask for those things.

Do not readily condemn what predecessors have established; they foresaw things you do not notice.

Likewise, do not readily grant perpetual favors, because it may be necessary to change them later, and you will no longer be able to do so.

Do not appear to throw away gifts, nor try to increase their value so that they may be pleasing.

Consider what needs someone is compelled by, and when; and if you have benefited others, do not tell this to others; you will offend them and seem to be reproaching them. And if you are forced to mention it, say it was a debt, and that you do not need or wish to accept thanks for it.

If something is given to you (even if very small), take care not to be ungrateful.

### Asking for Things

See that what you ask for does not strain the purse or demand much labor, and it will be enough to indicate to a friend that you are in need of this thing. For if he does not provide it then, he will not do so at your entreaty either. But show yourself grateful for what has been provided, so that he may notice that by this very act you are requesting more.

If you are about to request something serious, discuss other matters and explain your desires as if doing something else.

Be cautious when asking nobles, because they think they are being ordered. Bring in intercessors, the most illustrious persons, such as offspring to a parent, as long as you do not employ those who are in need of the same thing.

The time to ask is when someone is happy, which is on a feast day and after a meal, but not while he is drowsy, nor amid other business when he is distracted, nor when afflicted by sleep.

Do not presume to ask for many things at once.

When taking up someone's cause to promote, favor him as if he were unknown. Have rare meetings with him, so that you may seem to be moved more by honest and public affection than private.

Propose reasons and advantages to the persons with whom you are dealing: profits and losses to the greedy; the glory of God to spiritual men; praises to the young; and mockery from companions.

Do not ask a leader for privileges and charters, for such things are granted slowly. But at an opportune time, submit the written documents for him to sign.

Do not ask another for some rare thing if he is fond of it (especially if it is useless to you).
For if he refuses, he will think he has injured you and will hate you, for it is human to hate the one you have injured. If he grants it, he will shun you as an indiscreet petitioner.

Because it is shameful to suffer rejection, ask for nothing unless you are certain of obtaining it. Therefore it is better not to ask, but only to explain the necessity.

Let no one notice that you love the thing you desire before you are in possession of it. Therefore, either show despair or spread the rumor that it has already been destined for another, and congratulate him.

If something is denied to you, secretly send another to request it for himself, from whom you will more easily obtain the thing.

If someone wants to snatch from you an honor that you seek, send someone to him who will dissuade him in the name of friendship and show the difficulties.

### Admonishing

Begin by relating other matters, then exaggerate and condemn the deeds about which you wish to admonish, adding other circumstances, lest the listener realize he is being rebuked.

Often tell the listener to be of good mind and cheerful, mixing in jests. If he becomes sad, ask the cause, then at the end append everything else, even speaking about remedies in the abstract.

If someone knows he is suspected by you of some vice, put him in charge of secret matters, but not with risk. In order not to remove your suspicion of him, he will carry out the task with his whole heart. Therefore, it is sometimes expedient to show yourself as suspicious.

If you reprove headstrong youths who fall into illicit acts, you will only inflame them more. Therefore, it is better to await their repentance or satiety.

If it happens that you must change tactics, do not abruptly shift from harsh to gentle.

With cold people, one must act openly and incite fear; with fervent people, act cautiously and gently.

### Avoiding Deception

Give moderate trust to prudent men, because they too greatly understate what concerns their prerogatives; and because they put too favorable an interpretation on the reputation of others.
They will not admit if anyone has spoken ill of you in their presence, nor from whom you should beware, nor with what vices they struggle.
The same is true of priests when they praise their penitents, because they can say nothing but good about them, no less than parents about their children.

From one you fear may make complaints against you, raise a disturbance, or do something along those lines in your absence - keep him with you under the guise of friendship, in entertainments, hunting, at table, in conversation, in military service, etc.
Thus, to prevent neighboring nations from rebelling while you are entangled in another war, bring their leading men with you to the war with a small force, from which no treachery can be feared, as if they were most faithful.

It will be useful to have a mirror in front of you while you sit at table or write, so that you may see what is being done behind your back.

### Preserving Health

Pay attention here to avoid deficiencies or excesses in food, in terms of both quantity and quality, as well as in clothing with respect to heat and cold. Avoid distress in sleep, work, and location, and do not praise places that are excessively high. Repletion and evacuation are the sources of diseases; let motion and rest be moderate, and the passions of the mind not unbridled.

Do not dwell near swamps or even rivers.

The windows of your bedroom should face more to the North and East than to the South.

One should not pursue serious business for more than two hours at a time, but at intervals allow for some relaxation of the mind.

Foods should be well-prepared and such that they can be obtained anywhere.

Use Venus moderately in whatever state you remain, and do so according to the requirements of your own constitution.

### Avoiding Envy

Do not act as a witness because you will offend one side or the other.

Do not speak of anyone lowly or base, and do not give signs; if you scorn someone with a remark, continue the conversation as if it were nothing.  

In the presence of others, show no singular favor to anyone, because others, thinking themselves despised, will begin to hate.

Beware of sudden splendor, because it dazzles the eyes before they become accustomed to beholding it.

Do not accuse those things which are pleasing to the common people, whether vices or customs.

If you have the author of some odious deed, do not offer yourself to fresh hatred, nor do anything by which you may seem to approve of the deed, take glory in it, or mock those injured. These greatly increase envy. It is better to be absent and pass over the deed in silence.

Introduce nothing new in dress, appearance, or banquets.

If you make laws, do not show distrust of virtue, but compel all to act uniformly.  

Give reasons for things to satisfy everyone, but only after the fact, lest you be hindered.

Have it as a universal principle, but very justly, to speak neither well nor ill of anyone, no matter how much.
Do not report good or bad deeds; perhaps there will be a friend of the third party to whom you relate it, and so you will offend. And your words, increased for the worse, will at some point come to the one of whom you speak.
If you praise, perhaps the third party who hears will be less of a friend of the praised, and so he will become your enemy.
It is better, however, to know much, to see and hear, and to find this out, but circumspectly; for it is offensive to know that something is being sought about oneself, hence it must be sought in such a way that you do not seem to be seeking.

One must beware of a certain excessive generosity, for it seems that someone is being despised; as if you were to say that you have soldiers in a sack, you are not seeking them, etc.

Do not boast that you will proceed more strictly and rigidly by law than your predecessors, for this alienates friends; even if you do this by right, propose only those intentions you know to be pleasing.

Do not entrust to any of the servants either the right of individuals over others, or deal with him in such a way that you seem to act in common, especially if he is hated by the others, nor at least is he to be extolled with rewards, unless his virtue is clear to all, so that it may be an incitement.

If some severity must be done to your people, it should be carried out through others, and as if not by your command; so that if those affected complain, you can diminish it, and accuse those who did it, as if they were the sole authors of the severity.
E.g. the Tribunes, because discipline is lax, so that they may notice there is need for correction, and a harsh one at that, yet the manner is not prescribed, for they will sink to harsher things, by which they may avenge themselves, and they will give you the opportunity to show benevolence to appellants.

Whatever one has earned full glory from harshness, attribute everything to him, because thus it will return to you in full measure and without envy, and not doing this will itself be a glory.

Refer your good outcomes and successes to someone else's good, as if you had acted by their aid, auspices, or counsel.

In success, claim nothing for yourself.

Let your interactions, table, and clothing remain the same, and change them only in a certain way.

If someone must be punished, lead them to confess their own guilt, or commit the judgment to another who is secretly ordered by you to pass a harsh sentence, which you may then soften.

Do not insult the vanquished, nor your antagonist, and even if you conquer him, do not proclaim yourself the victor in deeds or words. Be content with true victory.

If you are compelled to pass an envious sentence, resort to an ambiguous manner of speaking, e.g. arguments for both sides, but be more serious for the one you intend, and seem to conclude for the other, or omit the conclusion.

If someone asks you to intercede, promise, and at the same time show that the matter is not in your hands and may perhaps turn out otherwise.

If vengeance is to be taken through another or an unknown person, order the injured party to grant pardon to the offender, but secretly allow him to flee as soon as possible.

If parents are quarreling, do not readily adhere to either side, but find business to be absorbed in, so you may be excused by both sides, and neither will know you are not on their side, even if you show no special friendship to either.

Do not be deemed the author of any new laws, especially adverse ones, point to superiors and the one who rules.

Be rare in public, readily report trivial matters to your superior, and do not boast of his friendship.

If you notice you can do everything with the powerful, know that whatever sin they commit will be imputed to you. Therefore, ensure the ruler sees your advice, accepts your intercessions, but in your absence arranges the matter otherwise. This should be especially held by confessors of princes.

If your family lineage or ancestors are praised, divert the conversation elsewhere, so they may notice this modesty of yours. Then the praise will be safe without envy. If you seem too pleased, hatreds will arise.

Do not be a public praiser of those things which are pleasing and favorable.

And if it happens that you are removed from office, openly show that a favor has been done for you, a provision for your peace, and seek out reasons to demonstrate this. Thus no one will insult you.

One should not openly inquire who was an enemy or their supporters, nor institute a conversation about it, but it will be in your interest to know everything secretly.  

Do not deal openly with those who are hated by all, nor suggest advice to them.

Never let it be known you were in a council in which hated things are believed to be done even against enemies, although you can be the author from afar.

Do not find fault with anyone's deeds, do not criticize, do not inspect the duties of others.

The places over which others preside, their fields, workshops, stables, etc. and places where they can see they are being observed. Do not go to these places of your own accord.

Inquire very cautiously from servants and boys about their masters.

See that in your manners, gestures, gait, conversation, play, manner and phrasing of speech, laughter, fervor, there is nothing that can offend.

However you are occupied, if someone approaches, respond most pleasantly and show that he is a welcome guest to you. Excuse him now so he may have another occasion to approach you. To attend to the good of your peace, much will have to be yielded from your comforts.

However much someone tells false and unproven things, listen while he tells it to others. Do not correct him or show that you know better. And do not seem to despise them with jokes and mockery, even to accept them as jokes or so they can notice they are being eluded as vain.

Even if things go badly for some, do not ridicule them. Rather, strive to excuse, entreat, and help.

Do not act toward those not subject to you in ways that seem to be exerting jurisdiction.

### Uncovering Secrets

Engage even people of low status in conversation; overcome by kindness, especially if you grease their palms with gold, they will disclose everything (the same can be achieved through boys, but with risk).

Servants should also be set against each other, so they will betray each other's secrets.

But keep your word faithfully with all, lest they lose confidence; and do not immediately use knowledge without examination.

### Discerning the Intention Behind Someone's Words

First, take his reasons, and from there see if they prove what he says he is doing; or rather what he usually does, and that of which he is suspected. Also, observe whether they act more fervently or more remissly than usual.

If he is not acting on his own behalf; or if he suddenly changes opinion with fervor, it will be a sign he has received bribes.

If after the reasons have been well refuted he does not acquiesce, he is not acting in those ways. Likewise, if the arguments are too elaborate, subtle, far-fetched, and contrary to nature, or frivolous, and yet he fervently pursues the cause.

If on different occasions, when promoting the same thing, he alleges different reasons, neglecting the former ones; because we forget those things which we do not speak from our own mind.

Send someone to deal with him confidently in the name of friendship and to frankly inquire about the cause. Then he will betray everything else.

### Avoiding Offense

If you have shown yourself more difficult or less free to someone in granting some request, take care not to show yourself liberal in a similar matter, however inferior or equal, within any period of time. Otherwise, you will either excite distrust toward yourself or hatred between them.

Never increase severity toward those you govern unless you also increase favors at the same time, for you will either incur hatred or contempt. But if you increase both, you will mix love with fear.

If you begin something new that offends the eyes of others or the Prince, lead him to see the fault as an example, and the envy will be mitigated by the multitude.

If you are believed to be the author of hateful counsels, do some good things openly among the people, such as remitting tributes, punishments, etc., especially to those who are accepted by the people.

If you are planning something unusual, first meet secretly with a theologian, etc., and win him over to your side, so that they may publicly advise, promote, and even compel you to do the same.

When you are about to impose new laws, show the necessity, and deliberate with the prudent about establishing it; or at least let there be a rumor that you used their counsel, and thus you are more prudent. Then, rejecting their advice, impose other laws by your own judgment.

Do not procure a wife, maidservant, etc. for anyone, or persuade them to a certain state of life.

Beware of acting as the executor of a will.

If you are in someone's retinue while he is organizing and commanding his household, be present indeed, but do not suggest or assist with the methods.

It happens that if someone comes to a new place, he may too freely extol the old ways and persons. You should be cautious in the common error.

Even if you feel the contrary, follow the more lax opinion, whether in matters of conscience or in others, yet preach the stricter one.

In the presence of no one should you show that you have power over superiors or have obtained a favor.

Thus, in the presence of no one should you reveal your opinion about another in any confidence.

Always soothe a superior with profit, in whatever office you may be.

It is better to be somewhat, or at least apparently, lax with subjects rather than strict.

If you hear that a presumed friend has spoken ill of you, do not reproach him. You will make an enemy of one who until now was indifferent.

Do not wish to know all the secrets of the great. If it happens to be divulged from elsewhere, suspicion will oppress you.

If someone is going to do something pleasing to you, e.g. congratulate, greet, etc., show that it is most pleasing to you. Otherwise, you will overturn it in the future.

If someone does not keep his word or deed as promised, do not reproach him. You will gain nothing but hatred.

As much as you can, allow yourself to be defeated by your lord in games, in which the contest is always about glory, not about any loss to you. Thus you are strong if you conquer other men, even if you are conquered by your lord alone.

In whatever familiarity you may have with your lord, never forget reverence and submission. Otherwise, he will think that familiarity breeds contempt.

Do not boast that you have won someone over to your side by your counsel, even if he was willing. He will resist more in the future.

Do not insult the bad outcome of one who did not obey your counsel. Rather, excuse the outcome in the executor.

To one boasting of his wealth, strength, dexterity in leaping, counsel, aid—do not act in a way that suggests you are not enjoying it. If you know his ignorance, feign ignorance yourself.

However, if you have been gravely injured by a superior, not only do not complain, but do not even let him notice that you were injured, because they hate the one they have injured.

Praise even the smallest gifts as the greatest, if from your lord. Boast that you love him supremely, show it.

Refuse dignities with your whole heart, and do not let many things be conferred on you that shine greatly but bring little utility.

### Encouraging Others to Act

To encourage someone to act, take responsibility for the losses they may incur and propose rewards.

For example, before a battle, a commander should proclaim recompense for specific wounds, that he will cover their losses in goods and baggage; meanwhile, he should place a strong garrison in the camp, lest concern for it distract the soldiers' minds.

### Acquiring Prudence

As much as possible, be silent and listen to the advice of others, and carefully weigh it in your mind.

Take care not to be carried away by the passion of love.

Do not value your own words and deeds too highly.

Do not occupy yourself with useless matters that will be of no future use.

Finally, do not entangle yourself in the affairs of others.

Freely attribute to others the glory of accomplishments, even if you have brought them a great monument. It will return to you, and indeed with interest - that is, without envy.

Beware of anger and revenge.

When the virtues of others are recounted, listen willingly.

Rarely marvel at rare things.

Give advice sparingly.

Do nothing simply to rival others.

Avoid lawsuits, even sometimes at your own loss.

Never show your precious or easily sought-after possessions to anyone.  

If someone incites you to do something, see that they offer themselves as a partner in the risk.

If an exhortation, request, or similar matter is to be made, and some business is to be undertaken, first read and seek judgments and similar cases in histories, so that you may be informed.

The rhetoricians should be reread from time to time; they suggest ways of stirring up envy, retorting, excusing, diminishing, etc.

Ambiguity must be sought, so that from our statements it may indeed be made clear to both parties, yet nothing concluded; for necessity sometimes compels this. According to Nazianzus, Aristotle wrote his opinions using this art.

Use this genre in books and in odious letters, counsel, forming reasons for both sides by way of discourse, but minimally declaring to which side you adhere or should adhere. Indeed, a digression will be made from this place, or amphibology, either by wishing, imploring, or declaring your affection through some rhetorical mode.

Allow yourself to be admonished, even about false things, and do not excuse yourself, because no one will then admonish you, but rather demonstrate every affection for what is useful.

Allow useless remarks to pass by; acknowledge some, even if they are false, so that you may appear flexible and not everywhere afflicted by error.

Train yourself in this, to always be able to give reasons for both sides; to this end, read the modes of the rhetoricians and apologies.

If you are an ambassador and deal with an enemy, write down for your leader whatever gift you receive from him, so that you may be held free from suspicion of infidelity. Apply this to other cases as well.

Do not send as an ambassador one who is averse to you, because he will give contrary advice and himself desires to rule.

Often have mixed counselors (for it is rare to find temperate ones) - one cold, the other fiery, one gentle and the other harsh. Consult them, and thus you will arrive at the best advice.

Always pay attention to which side fortune is turning or can turn, and have even the least servants of the ruler, and even the greater ones, on your side.

On each or certain days, have hours in which you premeditate how to act if this or that should happen.

Concerning servants and friends, keep a diary whose pages are assigned to each person, divided into four columns:

1. Note the losses received from that person, how often he failed in his duty.
2. What good you conferred on him with your labor.
3. What he accomplished for you.
4. What trouble he received from you, and what extraordinary labors.

Thus you will have everything at hand against complaints and for glory.

Put these rules into practice each day in conversation.

Whether you receive correction from a superior justly or unjustly, always excuse him in the presence of others and speak well of him.

As much as possible, promise nothing to anyone in writing, especially to women.

That which you are drawn to by the greatest passion and desire, avoid if you can, or at least adhere to it most cautiously.

Your affairs, even if they are most firm, never suffer from being further secured as much as possible.

Reflect on your own action after it has passed, and on another's - what it lacked, when it could have been seized, when it could have been better instituted, etc.

### Acting Cautiously

There are two parts to being a cautious man: *cautious trust*, acting on guard in the presence of friends (since many friendships exist to deceive), trust no one unless you suspect them.
The other is a certain *generosity*, we are unwilling to indiscriminately tell the truth to anyone or correct their errors and habits, instead a pretense of this is indeed preferred, but it is scarcely harmless.

Entrust a secret to no one, because there is no one who cannot become an enemy after an hour.

Do nothing when distracted by life's joys, or you will err or betray yourself.

Do not assume that anyone will interpret your deed favorably; there are scarcely two such interpreters in the world.

Entrust nothing to letters that you would not want read by a third party; in fact, put his praises in them, so that they may come into his hands.

If you perceive someone wishing to extract knowledge of a matter from you and pretending to know it, do not correct him when he errs.

Either dissemble the vices of others or excuse them; close off your own affections or assume their opposites.

In however great a friendship, consider hatred; in fortune, adversity.

If you are the victor, in no case return the noblest captives to the enemy, so that if fortune turns, the enemy may have a reason to be compelled to spare you.
Indeed, also do favors for the leaders of the enemies, maintaining some correspondence with them, unless pressed by an inexcusable necessity.

Act nothing for the sake of appearances, unless you are ready to give a reason for it, because people, not waiting for it, will condemn your deeds. Such is life now that certain virtues are condemned, not to mention doubtful ones.

If inferiors and servants ask something of you, order them to leave it in writing for you, so that you may be able to inspect all the circumstances more closely. You, however, give responses only orally.

If you will converse with some where there is danger of being caught at a word, protest that you say many things in jest, even trying contraries, conniving at some things. For this reason, if something happens rather incautiously, you will be able to excuse that you protested beforehand that you sometimes say certain things in jest.

If you are pressured by games, hunting, and Venus and carried away by passions, forbid them to yourself altogether, otherwise you are about to commit many things incautiously.

With infants, the elderly, the stubborn, and those of unstable memory, and also with tyrants, act as much as possible before witnesses.

Receive and request orders in writing.

Do not readily give advice to the more ferocious and impetuous; they judge by the outcome.

Where it is believable that you are being observed, speak very little; there is an easy lapse in many things.

In everything, observe vices and virtues, so that if there is need, you may be able to turn to one part or the other: this will be an armory useful for many things.

Have shutters on the insides of windows, and let the part where they meet the windows be black, so that it cannot be discerned whether the window is closed or not.

### Getting Rid of an Ungrateful Guest

Have a pre-arranged signal with a servant, so that when he receives a sign from you, he calls you away as if for urgent business, whispering in your ear or sending a messenger with letters, or announcing that harm has been done, or that there are disturbances among your subjects.

Have a doctor forbid you from speaking or drinking, etc.

Have a saddled horse brought, as if you are about to depart.

Give oats to his horses, but first shake a wolf skin over them. Provide a stable, but where a wolf's carcass has been buried.

Provide a bedroom, but in a bed made for this purpose with windows, and where it will rain, open them. The fireplace should be blocked so that it smokes; the furnace should be lit at first.

### Conversing with Others

Know yourself, from what background you come.

Some people's conversations are pleasing to no one at first, but gradually become sweeter, and their prudence does not immediately come forth as if from a vestibule.

Others are immediately prudent and learned, but bring a longer delay, and shamefully fail either in judgment or in consequences.

Therefore, temper your meetings in this way: If you are among the former, rarely engage in conversation, but at greater length; if among the latter, do so frequently, but briefly, where you are considered pleasing.

Be a rare guest, lest you become commonplace; in your conversations, consume the material with which you know someone to be affected, praising it. With some discuss statues, with others weapons, poetry, etc.

Do not deal with him while he is distracted by other business, because then he will pay you less attention.

With the melancholic, be serious; with the choleric, be warlike and patient, if you are inferior.

Do not affect gravity; with the learned or experienced in business, use few words and do not pile up many reasons, as on the contrary with the uneducated.

Consider the time, whether it is unsuitable; those who prevail by faction or favor, by whatever means, strive to make them your friends, intent on every occasion, premeditating, for example, if someone should constrain you with a remark in some gathering, conceive in some way a sting for pretending, responding calmly with words, and certainly persuade yourself that you will show yourself outwardly such as you have formed yourself inwardly.

If you must speak of a third party, let his name be unspoken, indeed the place, time, and all circumstances, lest perhaps the one passing by, if he should hear, may be able to guess of whom there is talk; things which are told with difficulty and are considered fictitious, even if they are most true, never utter again.

Deal reverently with all, as if they were your superiors.

Display sincerity in those things which, if divulged, will bring you no harm or praise, e.g., entrusted virtues, and not fictitious ones.

Beware of conversing with those who show themselves venal and ready for any crime against you, because they will also be against you.

Avoid the furious and the desperate, because to deal with them is a matter full of danger.

With rulers, always be sparing of words; they prefer to be heard than to hear. Here act the philosopher, not the orator, however familiar they may be, be reverent.

Give the first seats to the elderly, submit to their admonitions, praise and revere them, for they readily accuse.

Praise and venerate the boastful; among the uneducated, read their condition.

Be rare with the talkative, who have everything in their mouth.

Diligently praise what someone loves; censure what he hates. Acting to the contrary, even unwittingly, will offend.

When you deal with individuals, act as if you had that one as a friend, and no others.

### Joking

Include nothing obscene in your words or deeds (for this is the way of buffoons), and do not imitate the voices of birds or other animals.

A joke should never contain truths that the other person would blush at, defects of nature or character, for they leave a bitter memory. Also, do not relate another's misfortunes, whether present or absent; these are to be heard, not told.

For honest and pleasant conversation, read authors who relate events full of interest, and even poets, so that you may learn to mingle emotions.

Never act too freely or commit anything reprehensible in another's presence, no matter how close the relationship.

### Avoiding Ambushes

Pretend to have a quarrel with a friend, so that your enemy suspect it is a real quarrel, reveal their true feelings, and wishes to take advantage of the situation; then suddenly resist and oppose the enemy with your friend's strength combined.

This will also work against robbers setting an ambush on the road, or in other situations where you know there are ambushes; leave yourself exposed and proceed to where the ambushes will be set in motion against you, then flee and lead them into an ambush.

And if the ambushes are set by a powerful man, dissemble in your words, so that he does not take open action, but seek a middle ground in your responses, so that you neither fall into his traps nor show that you noticed the deceit.

If some people are inducing you to take some action, so that you may be harmed in doing it, show that you will do it with eager spirit, and prepare yourself for it, unless there is difficulty in grasping the means. Meanwhile, secretly plan the opposite.

### Acquiring and Retaining Money

Do not despise small gifts and be attentive to losses. Do not be lavish with them, such as allowing pieces of bread, food, or oats for horses to go to waste. Confer with good economists and learn their methods. Consider what can be sold, planted, or produced from your lands, and employ craftsmen for that purpose. Know your entire income and always have an eye on your affairs.

If you are going to incur expenses, first consider by what means you can recover just as much, so that nothing is lost. For example, if someone decides to give four thousand scudi to valiant soldiers, he should first announce monetary penalties for gamblers and similar vices, so that the expenditure may be refunded there.

Do not have precious utensils that perish with use or lose their value, but only enough to suffice for your status, such as silver vessels, in which the workmanship is valued more than the material. For if there is necessity, little will be returned for them. You will detect the deceit of a steward in this way: after he has given an account, as if having forgotten, order him to recite the same things from memory after a few hours. If they are false, he will give inconsistent answers.

### Gaining and Conferring Honors

First persuade that it is necessary to confer honor that is such as you yourself describe through the circumstances. Then excuse yourself from it, as if you had been in possession of it in the same degree as you are now. Strive for good and clear counsel and do many things that are pleasing to the public, such as the construction of public buildings, toward the poor, and those things that can be done without increasing the sudden taxes.

Do not rely on your talents and worthiness for any duties, as if they must necessarily be conferred on you, and as if there were no one else equally suitable. For they prefer to confer them on the unworthy rather than on such men. But act as if they were to be obtained simply by the grace of a patron. Anticipate with good offices and promise obedience. Bring in intercessors; do not promise empty occasions of serving. Diminish yourself and openly say you are unworthy and will give the greatest thanks.

If you have an office that requires a powerful person, and there is no one more powerful than you, bestow all of its revenues in perpetuity, so that anyone must bring their strength to it, not find it, and thus it will remain with your house.

Always strive for the highest things, so that if you study, study as much as you can, even spurning that boasting of talent which some learned men wish to seem to have in their studies. If you seek virtues, seek them in a high degree; attain the greatest dignities you can, and thus place yourself most securely in all places.

Do not grant the administration of goods permanently, but for a three-year term, so that if someone has increased the goods and managed things more peacefully, confirm them in the same position, lest security breed negligence.

While fortune favors you, use it, because it easily flees. While you are loved, seek what you can; feign mildness, anger, rewards, and anticipate with honor.

### Responding to Requests

Do not immediately refuse, but do so after some discussion; and if you have once refused, do not be fickle. Do not concede except for serious reasons. When about to refuse, ponder it for a while, then feign sorrow. Or have letters brought to you, or announce sad tidings, for which you should have a trusty servant prepared to make a sign, show by gesture and words that you cannot satisfy him.

Praise what he asks and if he persists in asking, take time to deliberate how you can satisfy your affection toward him. Entrust it to a previously instructed servant to carry out, teaching him the way of doing it, arranging for him to take care of it as if it were his own. If you refer him to another, lest he grant nothing to the petitioner, show him the way in which he can approach him.

The nature of the common people is to fly, die, or languish on impulse. Hence, if they ask for something unjust, do not refuse immediately, but put them off with splendid reasons and some favors. But if they desire something agreeable to themselves, do not delay; they will either be fixed or turn to the opposite. Allow the hatred of someone to be accepted by you, as it were; in this they are not as false as in love.

If an office cannot be refused to someone, grant one that brings danger to himself and does not disturb the administration of the army in the guise of honor, as the Romans once did by retaining men in the court with honorary duties.

Proclaim a set time of the year, or at least within three years, for a written catalog concerning servants, through folding doors, while you remove some from their duties, raise others higher, distribute favors, and even lend an ear to some petition. Announce that if anyone asks through himself, you will grant it, but deny it to him if he arranges it through others. In the future, let everything be denied.

### Assuming Various Affections

Compile for yourself examples of affections from the Poets, such as the *Palace of Eloquence* provides, and practice those you need until you have absorbed them.

Entrust yourself to no one, even your closest friend. You will pretend to do so, but have no less command over your countenance than your words in displaying an affection; no less can be read from the face.  

Master your own timidity, so that, conscious of a matter, you act no less boldly than in similar cases.

### Feasting

To best serve your interests when feasting, focus mostly on those things which can be preserved, such as candied fruits or wax figurines, fountains, mountains, self-playing music, also things that demand some artistry yet are still appropriate, such as bearing the coats of arms of those you entertain, expressed in wax, covering candelabras on the table, drinks of various colors, and the same with different scents, as if imported from afar, also artificial wines, such as *Arnoldus de Villanova* describes.

Present flowers, colored lettuces, giant eggs composed of many and seasoned with spices, candles burning from ice, fragrant fires, vomiting mountains, fountains sprinkling snow, and fake fragrant fruits, or apples brought to the table on the very branch - all things which can grow in your garden at little expense.

Even the pot-herbs should be presented as if exotic, imbued with colors and flavors. Mix fruits in bottles and clusters, meats prepared in various and rare ways, of which *Apicius* offers very many, because at the table it is not what is praiseworthy, but what is rare that is esteemed.

Likewise, mix live crabs with cooked ones, counterfeit meats with bones made from flour, fish made from meats pressed in wooden molds, syrups poured in place of broth. Have a wheel made of ice, which falls apart on its own.

Some things should appear that spontaneously change color, disappear and reappear; cheeses variously formed and seasoned; even the vessels in which they are carried can be made, for instance, of fake gems.

### Avoiding Losses

Pay attention to even the smallest faults, and have your agents immediately report to you from where any harm may be imminent, so that the need to act is not delayed until it has happened, and at the same time let them suggest a way of averting it.

The rates for buying and selling things should be observed, and experts should be consulted about unknown matters.

Each week, have the steward give an account of what has been done, and have one person, after everyone has retired, search the house to see if everything is locked and who is absent.

If you hold any office, refer every expense and income, however benevolent the Master may have been, most candidly in the accounts.

### Acting in a Novel Way

At the outset, contemplate four things:

1. First, will it be useful to you, or more harmful?
2. Second, does nature supply you with the gifts for this?
3. Third, does it suit your status?  
4. Fourth, are you valued there, where you choose?

### Not Losing a Bargain

If you are betting with someone on the outcome of something, at the same time bet the same amount with another person on the opposite outcome of the same thing, and thus you will lose nothing.

In burdensome contracts, include indeterminate conditions that can be interpreted more broadly or narrowly, e.g. that upon the city's surrender you will preserve everything, if no uprising is incited - do not specify publicly or privately, by your men or others. If necessary and fairness demands, you will reject the agreements.

In promises, say "if you do this or that to my satisfaction", etc. It will be easy to demonstrate a defect.

### Covering Mistakes

If you happen to stumble in speech or act thoughtlessly, pretend you said it suddenly to test the judgment of others, or that in expressing one thing you said another. Smile as if your goal was achieved, or grieve as if it was not.

If you have erred out of ignorance in some matter, do not inquire of anyone in such a way that they notice you are unaware or have erred. Also, premeditate how you would seek the truth, or ask another's opinion on what they would do in such a case, while concealing your own, lest you be noticed as ignorant.

If you have forgotten something you said (which happens to those not feigning), take care not to say the opposite by chance, whence it will be expedient to have noted the main points you stated.

Be most cautious in confounding others, for you will betray either your ignorance or intention. Therefore, provide for both beforehand.

### Stirring Up Hatred Against Wicked Men

Praise the one you need to be motivated by favor in the presence of the one whose favor he enjoys, but in such a way that the praise may turn to the offense of his patron. Add that such things are commonly rumored, saying you are not expressing your own opinion, leaving the conclusion that he should look out for his own reputation, and that this very thing should be intimated - that his neighbor's reputation is in jeopardy. At the same time, he should be reassured to disregard rumors and let vain things grow old, yet let him feel the matter concerns him.

Or praise the client as if sympathizing with his affections, with a plaintive voice, and propose them well exaggerated along with their consequences. Say he is outstanding but blemished by this vice, which conceal. Never threaten one you intend to harm, for he will take precautions. Instead, pretend you are unequal and unable, even if you wished.

Draw him back into friendship with you, engage him in feasting, so as to render him unguarded, and have hidden witnesses before whom you say, so that he may blurt out something, either against the ruler, etc. This will provide material for an accusation.

Exaggerate the deed of an enemy, what evils will follow unless he is punished. Meanwhile, to appear less motivated by passion, deprecate punishment, but ineffectively, and as if from a distance hatred must be cast. His character and deeds must be interpreted, and when the occasion allows, he must be driven into ruin with faltering steps.

Never attack many at once, but form friendships with others in the meantime. Always secure your own affairs before attacking those of others, and do not indulge in revenge or neglect occasions for conducting your own business.

### Dissolving a Friendship

When dissolving a friendship, never abruptly break it off, as if from hatred after receiving an injury. Instead, having reconciled and showing fervent love, gradually withdraw. So that it may gently dissolve completely, meet infrequently and, if occasion demands, briefly converse, invite to dinner, as if burdened by business, so that you do not seem to be a friend only now, when you have cast him out.

If he seems to rely on the goodwill of some Patron, advise him to seek something precious from that Patron, something so dear that the Patron would never part with it. When he is inevitably refused, emphasize how such a minor request was denied, exaggerating the incident as if occupied with other matters.

Persuade him to borrow things from a friend that he will likely damage, such as horses for a long journey or clothing for a feast, at a time when he will need them himself. Thus, whether harm is done or not, the result will be the same.

Or suggest that he ask for any other things without designating a time for their return, so that he may harm himself by the labor of reminding or returning them. Let him be ashamed to meet the other, and so the friendship will gradually cool.

Let it be rumored that he lives by his friend's advice, can do nothing on his own - indeed, that his friend denies him his house, even his household. Point out his burdens, and so they will meet less often and drift apart. Or arrange for a friend to entrust him with a secret, which you meanwhile cause to become known to others. In this way, he will consider his friend's trustworthiness suspect.

### Praising Others

Under the pretext of frankness, act as though you speak and act only according to your own judgment and for the public good, hating nothing more than flattery.

The subject's mildness and clemency should also be excused as a debt of piety, so that his rigor may languish.

Never utter praises which, while praising one person, openly disparage others, except perhaps where there is a crowd and many confused voices.

Therefore, leave your friend's virtue unpraised and overlook his vices.

### Preventing Someone from Declining a Duty

To their objection or excuse, say that you will satisfy their request when it becomes evident that you have not looked out for their best interests.

Leave letters to be read after a certain day of your departure, meanwhile announce his office to everyone. If he writes letters back to you, do not respond to them at all.

If he deprecates orally, say that he is simply in that office for a short time and will soon be freed if it seems fit.

Exaggerate his labors so that he can demonstrate his merits to repel the envy of others.

Then say this office is conferred only on those who are to be promoted to greater things, whose virtue is perfect.

### Controlling Anger

Do not be quick to anger at anyone, because very often you will find that the matter was reported maliciously, and you did not understand it. If in the meantime you do something out of anger, the harm will remain with you.

If you are injured, it is best to dissemble, because quarreling breeds quarrels, and peace is lost. And even if you conquer the person, this will be harsher than being conquered, and meanwhile you will stir up more opposition against yourself.

Respond to those who restrain you in the best way possible, sometimes speaking ironically or maliciously. Respond candidly to their words, not to their intention, and meanwhile pretend to be occupied with other cares.

If someone accosts you on the road, not naming you indeed, but denouncing the deed of which you are suspected, seriously accuse the same deed and the wickedness of such men as if you were in no way conscious of it. Or pretend not to understand and respond about entirely different matters.

But if he even names you, act as if he were not seriously rising up against you, but feigning anger. Then append jocular remarks that do not disparage him, but dispose him to cheerfulness, or rebuke yourself along with him as if there were some third party, and you would carp more than he would. And after they have left off, show by lighter means how futilely those things, though excellently denounced, were exaggerated, and how trivial the cause is.

If it happens that you are received by someone in an unfitting manner, dissemble and hide the enmity, and act in the same way as if you had been received honorably. Thus his rudeness will be a punishment to him and a source of confusion, and he will compensate for his error with kindness.

If someone rails openly against new honors, defending their cause will suit your nobility. Bring forth the praises of ancient blood - let the reason be equal concerning other cases.

If you are openly assailed with abuse, so that there is no place for dissimulation, have jocular responses ready at hand, or begin some little story, which will be relevant to the matter in any case, through which, however, a way may be prepared for other discussions to follow.

Have some who, at a given signal, will offer letters for these cases, and when you have read them, say that something amusing has happened, to which he may be called away by chance to witness.

Leave time for the enemy, so that he himself may realize the unworthiness of the deed, yet do not propose it to him, lest the occasion for anger seem to arise from your side. It is also customary for anger to arise if someone infallibly resolves to complete a task within a certain time, and meanwhile something occurs - beware of such resolves.

### Fleeing

Carry acid with you, like burnt wine, with which to drench your clothes stuffed with straw and suspend them. The guard will believe you acted out of desperation and, neglecting his watch, will spread word to the others. Seize the opportunity.

Feign illness, such as bloody stools by eating red ochre, alter your pulse by pressing near the elbow, induce pallor. Hence request that a doctor be summoned. Complain of being fatigued by insomnia. Request to be transferred to the guard's house and to dine with him that day. Ask for a sleeping draught, which you will offer your host in his drink.

While preparing for escape, tell your companions you will flee by sword, so that if any of them are questioned by pursuers, they will dash their hopes of catching you.

Leave a bloody sword on the road or clothing on a riverbank, as if you had thrown yourself into the waves. Or persuade your comrades to retreat to safety, and when you are alone, burn down the isolated house you are in, as if you had perished in the flames.

Have a manageable horse, double its shoes affixed with nails, and bring durable provisions.

Never inquire about only one route, but several at once, and in sight of someone, plan the escape you least intend. Likewise, when leaving cities and villages, first go into the fields, then change your clothing, cloak, and appearance, and return by the proposed route.

If the pursuers are pressing close, leave behind a wounded horse. When it falls into their hands, they will suspect you have been killed. Leave your cap floating in a river or well, so that you may be believed drowned.

Also, have a horse blanket with wide seams, whose color you can change at will, and a mask molded from hide, painted on both sides with different faces, so that you can assume them as you please.

### Punishing and Correcting

Do not strike with your own hand, lest you acquire cruelty. If someone must be well punished, and a serious case is lacking, prepare it in this way: Punish a mild offense, even one which you could or usually would forgive. The offender will resent it and begin to complain and grumble. When punished again, he will complain again, until as if obstinate, he will give greater cause for a greater punishment, having been found guilty of a serious offense.

Young people are sometimes more inflamed by punishment; therefore, certain things should be permitted to them, but such things that satisfy their desires and do not incite them to other things (that is, they do not need anything else to obtain these, nor do they lead to similar things).

If you have removed someone from your household, court, or office, and others take it badly, spread the rumor and openly grieve that you at last noticed he inclined you to the public detriment of your subjects, and especially of those who lament his downfall. Henceforth, their affairs will be in a better state. But to be able to suffice for all these things, to confirm them, do things that instill trust, such as if you removed a steward, take care that the wages which he was responsible for are immediately paid.

Administer justice liberally in another's skin where your own loss is not inflicted, as if your Governor oppressed the subjects. Let the favor to be returned remain (if the public cause so demands), so that they may attribute to themselves the repetition of their goods, at least to oblige themselves to some burden of their own accord.

If you wish to correct someone, deliberate with him about the remedies. He will have none more pleasing than those he himself discovers. Likewise, let him set his own punishment.

In inquiring, do not act as an enemy. Dissemble when you can without harm to yourself and abstain from insults toward the well-born. Give him letters to deliver to a certain agent of yours, letters of recommendation for others. Secretly issue instructions containing his punishment.

If you wish to lead someone back to the right path, put him in charge of correcting in others the very vice with which he himself struggles, e.g. a drunkard should exact punishment from drunkards.

If someone humbles himself sufficiently and publicly, spare him, lest by despair you drive him to worse. Nor compel him to that which the guilty party will most refuse. Be content with a moderate vengeance.

After a moderate punishment has been decreed, one should wait to see if perhaps a new life may arise.

When you proceed to the guilty, do not show that you have cut off all avenues for them, so that no one may acquire wrath by hearing their crimes unheard. Show that you were born to clemency.

### Quelling a Sedition

Never allow more than one to deal with you at a time, but let them choose one from among themselves. Philosophers inquire into the causes of an uprising; if it is due to usury, lend without interest yourself. Offer great rewards to whoever quells the sedition, suggests a way to resolve it, eliminates the ringleaders, or betrays them.

If the people are fierce, they must above all be brought to virtue by good men; the fear of God and piety must be instilled, for these alone will soften them. The instigators of the factions must be accused with false rumors of seeking hidden private gain and dominion at the expense and bloodshed of the people, and that they will gain no advantage from it.

### Hearing and Speaking Self-Praise

Care should be taken not to let praises lead to comparisons or claims of uniqueness, even if true, because they rarely find credible belief.

If someone openly praises you in the presence of the Prince, doubt whether he has secretly accused you. When you are praised the most, beware lest you are led into a trap. When all your actions are praised, and thanks are given for everything, and you are preferred to all others, hold all these things most suspect.

Do not say all that you can do through boasting, for you will inform your adversary.

If you wish to spread your glory through books, such as those containing panegyrics, do so with a book that is easily purchased by all and esteemed in various parts of the world. And so the authors of such works should be known beforehand, and they should insert your name and praises; for these will spread your fame more than a huge volume that no one will buy or read.

### Having Internal Peace

Do not resolve for yourself that you will by all means accomplish something within a set time, because either you will meanwhile omit many unforeseen intervening matters, or if you are hindered, you will be disturbed.

Persuade yourself that it is not likely your own people will avoid every error, let nothing be planned.

Disregard the complaints of your subjects about you; keep a secret either not accepted as a secret or held.

Avoid others' deposits.

With men suspected of loquacity, deal no more than with customary formulas, such as "How are you?" etc.

Promise your assistance in interceding to no one of your own accord; if it does not succeed, you will be disturbed.

Do not personally oversee the work of craftsmen.

Have no dealings with complaining, groaning women and the obstinate.

If you are compelled to go to places that do not please you, refuse to conduct your business there; deny it and act there as if the places were destined for other uses.

### Disregarding Criticism

Praises and mockeries, flatteries and taunts - nowhere is the human race more deceitful. Gather written lampoons and read them yourself, and have them read by others. Laugh at them, for in this way the author will despair.

Do not reveal a lampoon written against you. Invent business if it must be revealed. But if the lampoon must be displayed, read it often at home and learn to laugh at it, assume appropriate emotions, imagine that you are mocking it in the meantime, and pretend objections and premeditate fitting responses with an assumed emotion.

It is not always to be concealed if something adverse happens, lest by the very dissimulation it may be believed to have happened more truly.

### Acquiring Dexterity in Acting

When sympathizing with someone's suffering, console them, as the Rhetoricians say, through commonplaces, without touching on anything that may offend them.

If someone is disparaged in your presence, be most cautious - neither praise nor condemn. Both are odious.

Speak well of your superiors, even if you have been offended by them, and do not allow or dissemble when another speaks ill of them, even if it pleases you.

You will detect the truth of those who accuse someone before you in this way: Listen to the accusers orally and note down the points, then order them to give these to you in writing. Say you are doing this so that the accusations may be read to the face of the accused. Compare and you will know the truth.

### Averting Suspicion

Read the section *Gaining Favor*, *Avoiding Offense*, and *Acting Cautiously*.

If you are suspected of having stained some accusers before the Prince, write letters to him containing praises, and send them *so that they reach those who suspect you*.

Or if you wish to vex them, allow letters unwritten inside to be intercepted, so that they suspect various artifices such that the writing could be read by water or fire.

Or rather write only the *first and last* syllables of each sentence, and openly pray that you do not wish them to reach the Prince's hands, lest you seem to be a flatterer.

### Overthrowing and Deposing Wicked Men

If someone is to be deposed from office, first do not provide him with money for necessary expenses for some time, so that he contracts such debts as will suffice for punishment when he is removed from office. The debts should not be held valid, so that the creditors themselves may demand from him; thus you have punished him financially without trouble.

If the one to be deposed currently enjoys the favor of a ruler, first deposit with him a sum of money, or something which the ruler guards most carefully, or which concerns his wife most. Remove it from him secretly by night (this should be done in the manner of a joke). At the same time, the ruler should be warned to beware of treachery, and that the servant has been corrupted. All these things must be planned in advance.

If it is feared that the injured party may stir up disturbances, as when you wish to deprive a general of his office, first arrange for him to be suddenly bound, and do this so secretly that it does not appear to be happening. Finally, hand over his army to an equal, give payment to the army from your own funds, lest they miss their lost general.

If someone disputes too forcefully at the table, asserting something false, order paper to be brought so that he may write down his opinion, sign it, and dispute it tomorrow. And if you notice some proud man seeking your office, for which he is unequal (as if you are a general, for this type is especially prone to rivalry), provoke the enemy, make everything difficult, while still providing well for yourself regarding provisions for the fortress.

Ask, as if distracted by another war, that he may succeed you, and do not give him an account of the war, the places, or the enemy. Thus he will fall into difficulties, and do not hasten to his aid until he recognizes both himself and you.

If it is expedient for some youths to be completely subverted, so that they may be treated gently against their will, they will be broken by singing, painting, sculpting. Let them have desperate servants as tutors, who value nothing in honesty, who are venal in everything, who indulge the desires of youths rather than govern them.

The same holds for others, to whom you suggest such desperate servants, so that the languishing may stumble upon them. Send sluggish senators to a sluggish Senator. Through an unknown person, send responsive letters from his friend, and allow them to be lost as if through the bearer's sloth, so that they may be read by many and his affairs do not succeed.

Impose many things to be done by him at once, so that he may accomplish nothing. Persuade him to seek and ask for many things. Kill his animals, in which he delights, by guile, e.g. by providing foods seasoned with pepper or saffron, so that the animal may be rendered rabid.

Alter with drugs the horse which he is about to use, so that upon receiving the rider, it may be rendered furious. Propose immense rewards for him to enter, for instance, the lion's den - you will see him fall into an evidently dangerous situation.

### Traveling

Never reveal your money to anyone, in fact always claim to have very little money if asked by others who have no business knowing where you come from. Deceive them as much as you can, entrust to no one which direction you are heading. Always ask some people which way one goes, and get different answers from different people.

Beware not to join quarrelers, for they are accustomed to start fights so that if you enter them, they may rob you and steal your goods. Indeed, when attacked with any taunts, dissemble.

Beware also to trust those who are splendidly adorned as if of noble blood, unless you know otherwise of them from another source, for they are often masked thieves.

Do not get into bed unless you first examine it all around with a light. Likewise with food. Do not employ the servants of the host for attendance on you, lest by this access they may spy on your bags.

Always carry some book with you, to deceive the time.

Have safe companions, and let them run ahead rather than follow.

In slippery and mountainous places, it is useful to employ iron tools.

One should walk on the tips of the feet.

Be brief in speech, lest even in much speaking you sin against your money or your life.

Oxen proceed more safely than horses through mountains.

### Not Desiring Vain Things

When dealing with a serious matter of great importance, concede the frivolous path to others, such as applause, glory, etc.

If an enemy wishes to surrender a city, offer the most honorable conditions: let him recognize he is not conquered, but doing a favor; let him depart with banners unfurled, and let nothing vain that a victor could wish for be lacking to him, provided that he yields the lands, hands over the captives, and leaves behind the gold and fortifications - and this when the sun sets.

The same applies to matters that are valued for the subtlety or variety of the work, such as flowers, etc. Allow others to have such things as a reward, not you.

Never premise admonitions, so that you may suffer some harm in the present from this person, as if by chance he should vow to show himself grateful to you in return. Words, and no more, are worth only as much as you should expend on words. Forgetting such things at once, your own loss always remains with you.

Let others have glory and renown without you; seek power alone for yourself.

If you are promoted to something splendid, take care also to promote one whom you fear may stir up trouble, but let him enjoy the glory of the office, not the fruit.

### Arguing and Correcting

That is a suitable time when the subject expects nothing but praise and comes to give thanks. Then reprove him. This is not a clever mode of arguing.

Also praise even the smallest deeds, for thus diligence grows. It is best to admonish through a friend of his, in confidence and secretly.

If someone is entangled in illicit loves and you wish to free him, bury him in tumultuous business. Suborn some to criticize his words or deeds, report them to you, bear false witness, and approve none of his actions.

See, moreover, with whom he deals; cut them off. No less should companions of the same kind be associated with him in this - men with men, women with women, because the opposite sex has proven harmful.

Companions should be assigned who, if not by virtues, at least labor under contrary vices. This one fierce, that one smooth; these ardent, those relaxed.

### Simulating Affections

You will pretend to display affections for an extended time if they are commonly seen in public, but eventually people will oppose it. Therefore, it is better to abstain from the light and entice others who truly have such affections to do the same.

It will be best for you to be distracted by serious matters in the meantime, so that you may forget even the very affection which you wish to pluck out. Thus no one, however much they may observe you, will gather wrath and joy from you.

### Avoiding Lending Money

Order a servant, who is handing over the items, to provide a receipt in which everything is described, to be signed as if he were taking up his own cause without your knowledge.

If you cannot avoid this situation, it may be expedient to proclaim yourself a debtor, or to simultaneously request to borrow something equivalent in return, pretending that you are in need, or that you indeed do not have an abundance of the money your friend is requesting, but that you can find it, and indeed without interest, provided that he offers collateral, or if he has things to be divided, their price will increase in the summer, if he deposits something with you.

### Arriving at the Truth

To obtain another's true judgment about your affairs, act as if someone else were delivering your speech, or read your own deed and refer to it as pertaining to another. Thus inquire about their judgment: people form different judgments, and humanity among friends is different. Therefore, trust if you are modestly praised.

Attributing some praise is humane; ascribing no praise, inquiring curiously about the matter, approving nothing about the deed, is inhumane.

### Accusing

Be the last to accuse, and do not bring a lawsuit against one whom you know to be more favored by the judge than you, unless you have first noticed the judge's mind turning to your cause.

If you have brought a lawsuit, or one has been brought against you, even if your cause is most just, act as if it were extremely bad. Approach and influence the judges with gifts; approach your adversary through mediators who may meet with him. Seek to premeditate exactly and at leisure those things which can be objected to you, what may be answered - yet keep all things most secret.

By no means be induced to show your rights or privileges to anyone, for you will give them something to notice and exploit.

Also recognize the nature of the one by whom you are accused - fierce or ignorant - so that you may know how to control yourself. If fierce, choose a time when he is in a fervor; if ignorant, one must act slowly. Care must also be taken that the accused in no way knows that he has been accused, and in what cause, but that the accusation may come upon him suddenly, which disturbs even those well-practiced in their own cause.

Also choose those who may promote your side, it matters little of what rank or appearance the men are, provided they are dear to the judge. And involve them in danger, showing that their case is at stake, so that they may persuade themselves that they cannot acquiesce except at their own extreme peril.

Moreover, act so that all the accusations may be carried out, not in the manner of a cause or lawsuit, but of friendship or secret admonition. Mix in more atrocious things from the judge's own vices, which, because they are true, will also be believed about the defendant. Let the judge himself beware, so that he may notice his own reputation, honor, and life are in jeopardy.

In the presence of the judge, show all mercy toward the defendant, that you are moved only by public evils, perhaps to accuse his fortune, that you must denounce the case of an otherwise rightful friend.

### Being Accused

Conceal it if you notice that you have been accused by someone, and do not suddenly correct yourself in what you were accused of, lest the informer boast that his accusation was favorably received by the one to whom he reported it.

Instead, given the opportunity, call him an enemy, an informer, suggesting that such people are wanted, as traitors are usually desired, but never loved.
And thus he will usually argue that if he maligns others in your presence, he will do the same to you in the presence of others, indeed, there is less prudence and harmony among those who are not allies, but rather critics of each others.
Should he find such men useful to himself, he will eventually reveal his true feelings towards such individuals.

Go to the one who accused you, consult what must be done in this accusation, seek as if from an intimate friend.

In the presence of another, if he has spoken ill of you, trying to turn that person against you, speak favorably about a third person, with whom you are connected, in the presence of the same individual.

At the onset of the dispute, expose the accuser as a co-conspirator, or have the trial conducted in his presence, particularly in matters that are agreeable, as once the accuser had to put down for the judges in the year of military service.

If you are accused of multiple offenses, do not deny everything, lest you forfeit all credibility. Acknowledge certain things, even if untrue, to avoid the impression that you are malleable and universally prone to mistakes.

Often it will proves beneficial, if you know that you have been reported to your superior, not to clear yourself unless he demands it. This will provoke him further, you will stir him up, but initially avoid it as much as possible or do the opposite.

### Visiting Provinces

Upon arriving in any region, first, let no accounts be kept, but whatever is worthy of note, whether good or bad, should be recorded in an unknown language, not the common one, lest if a native should notice, he may take offense.

Second, examine all sacred things in places both public and private, such as temples inside, epitaphs, offerings, tombs of illustrious men, symbols of the dead, organs, columns, pulpits, etc., as well as fortresses, mountains, forests, valleys, rivers, and their nature, outpourings, sources, and the origin of their names.

Third, note the constitution of the air, as that of Rome is not praised by newcomers, while that of Bologna and Padua is better, and the lengths of nights and days.

Fourth, observe the location of cities, what part faces which direction of the world, the mines of each metal, hot springs, ships, ceremonies, bells, clocks, etc. These should be inspected cautiously. Towers, as in Germany the three most noble besides the others, in Vienna, Strasbourg, and Landsberg. The coats of arms and origins of cities, aqueducts, wonders, and sieges.

Fifth, the rites of Academies in conferring degrees.

Sixth, arts and artisans, armories, and in these, machines, marbles, palaces, modes of feasting, the capacity of the soil for various seeds.

Seventh, the state of the Republic, the power of the Bishop, the custom in weddings and festivals; commerce, piety, wealth, pursuits - each to be inquired about from those experienced in them. Note especially those things useful to you, what chiefly delights that Nation, in what respect it can be conquered.

How in every place, name, and form the manner of speaking is noted, how fruits and gardens are preserved, and caves and mines.

Do not enter subterranean places prone to errors without being well-equipped with a flint, and place some candles in various spots. If you enter alone, follow Ariadne's advice and take a very long thread, so that you may be able to exit by following it. Because often the air in these caves is noxious, bring perfumes and ointments, and well-fortify yourself before entering.

Praise the nation among whom you live, and blame the one this nation reviles.

### Reading Speculative Books

When reading an assertion, consider what it teaches, how many points it makes, what individual words are used and in what order, what can be inferred from it, and how the assertion is proven - by reducing the arguments to dialectical form and anticipating responses. Are the premises sufficiently firm? How can the minor premise be confirmed and what instances can be brought forth? With what thesis does it agree or seem to conflict?

What objections could be raised against it? How could the art's text, paragraphs, and scripture be explained? What does the opposing view assert, in how many points does it disagree, how does it prove each one, from what principle, what is the objection, form, and response to each part? Apply this and judge where something is lacking, what the adversaries could deny, and what they could retort against it in turn.

Consider the very objections the author reads and how they could be otherwise resolved and advanced. How could some difficulty be more clearly posed and in what words, and what does it consist of? Do not immediately apply the conclusion to particulars, as natural philosophers apply physical causes to fire, trees, or angels, or as theologians apply, for example, what they say about the sacraments in general to the other sacraments.

Do not be content to have read it once, but on different occasions read the same thing. Often what the intellect could not grasp with much labor before will occur to you spontaneously later. And if someone explains it to you, first reread it yourself, so that you may acquire the ability to argue through each place, as the dialecticians call it, and for and against each assertion.

Finally, ask what discourse could be of use in a discussion with physicians or scholars based on this speculation.

## Summary

Keep these five things in mind:

1. **Simulate.**
2. **Dissimulate.**  
3. **Trust No One.**
4. **Praise All.**
5. **Be Mindful of Your Actions.**

#### Simulate, Dissimulate

Show yourself a friend to all and converse even with those you dislike, so that you may also learn caution from them.

Restrain your anger in every possible way, for that alone will bring you more ill repute than many virtues will bring commendation.

Always strive to choose the easier path, in order to more readily obey the majority, because taking the more difficult course brings with it more disadvantages. When faced with a difficult action, choose the easier of the two.

Always take care that no one knows what you think about a matter, what you know, what you want, what you care about, or what you avoid.

It is not wise to conceal your virtues too much, nor to blame lengthy sacred rites, lest you seem irreverent.

Even if you can obtain something in a harsher way, do not employ that method.

#### Trust no One

When he praises you, be convinced that he mocks you.

Do not entrust any secret, for you are often despised.

Do not praise or disparage yourself; others lie in wait for you, to seize upon your words.

Do not show freedom in your manners, by which you will be judged.

If someone disparages and vexes you, consider it a test of your virtue.

They feign friendship, but they are not friends.

#### Praise All

Always speak well or not badly of everyone, so that if a third party hears of it, he will know and report back to the person you praised.

Always speak well of your superiors, for it serves the peace. Also praise those whose favor you need, as well as the food and clothing you receive from another.

#### Be Mindful of your Actions

Consider what you say. Could it be taken in a better sense? If so, it certainly will be - perhaps someone is watching, or listening, whom you do not see.
