# Breviarum Politicorum

## A Word from the Publisher

Weighed down by the most serious affairs, I had delayed sending this Political treatise, which an Italian Prince had sent me to publish, to the printers. Now, by order of the same Most Excellent Prince, I am making it public. The dignity of the material, and the name of His Eminence Cardinal Mazarin, according to whose model and standard of life the things proposed here are especially arranged and composed, will add no slight weight to the political rules that are commonly proposed. For no one is unaware of how the Most Eminent Prince was immersed in the most serious storms, and all but overwhelmed.

But it is not so readily apparent to everyone by what arts he overcame those various tides of adverse fortune, by which he seemed bound to be overwhelmed, by swimming through them, and arrived most happily at the port of safety; what great things he applied in the administration of a most powerful Kingdom, distracted by various factions, in those most perilous and difficult times; and emerged from very many and various difficulties with increased glory; and, what is no slight thing for his glory, imbued the mind of *Louis XIV*, easily the Greatest of all the Kings of France, with those precepts of ruling, by which, upon taking the helm, he greatly expanded the borders of France far and wide, and raised it to the highest peak of dignity and power, before he took his seat at the helm. It is difficult to excerpt, but this Treatise will relieve you of that burden.

And since there is hardly any complete and perfected system of Political precepts, since the particular circumstances which greatly vary the general rules are infinite, therefore no easier or more felicitous method can be handed down than if we make that discipline, which is supported only by general precepts, practical or active by adapting those general rules to those particular circumstances on which they depend.

But you will more easily achieve that aim, (kind Reader,) if you strive to keep before your eyes this illustrious example, according to whose prototype, as it were, of a political leader and standard-bearer, today's Politicians attempt to conform themselves and adapt their rules by their own prudence: However, I would wish you to conduct yourself in such a way that you may indeed have a clear understanding of the reasons and norms which Political men are accustomed to use, yet not so that you may deceive, but so that you may not be deceived, by joining both of these norms of the highest prudence, which both that general rule of equity and justice, and the precept of the Gospel prescribe:

> *Do not do to another what you would not want done to you, Be wise as Serpents, and simple as Doves.*

Enjoy this labor of ours, and farewell.

## Fundamentals

There were once two fundamental principles in sincere Philosophy: *Sustain and Abstain*. Now, new principles prevail: *Simulate and Dissimulate*, or *Learn About Yourself* and *Learn About Others*, which (if I am not mistaken) also reinforce the former.

We will first address *Learn About Yourself* and *Learn About Others*. Then, since human *Actions* generally occur without any set order, we will explore *Simulate and Dissimulate* in various contexts, without adhering to any particular sequence.

### Learn About Yourself

Are you overcome by anger, fear, rashness, or some other passion? What defects are evident in your conduct, at the table, in church, in conversation, in games, along with other actions, especially social ones? Examine all the parts of your body: is your eye too insolent, foot or head bent too far, forehead wrinkled, lips unkempt, gait too slow or fast?

With whom do you associate - are they praiseworthy, fortunate, prudent people? At what times are you rendered most incautious - do you stumble in word or deed? At the table when you are drunk? In games, or in calamity? For according to Tacitus, "the minds of mortals are pliable" at such times.

What places do you visit - are they suspect, vile, disreputable, unworthy of you? Be cautious in your actions, and never let caution be absent - to which end reading this little book will serve. In what place, at what time, in what station, and with a person of what rank are you acting?

Mark down each individual defect, so that you may attend to it all the more strictly. It will be beneficial, whenever it happens that you slip up, to impose something rather harsh on yourself. If you are provoked to the point of an outpouring of bile, say nothing, and show no sign of anger, provided you are in such circumstances where you can show your zeal to no purpose, and cannot satisfy yourself; but *pretend* that you are not injured in the least, and await a more opportune hour.

Show nothing in your face except kindness, or even affection. Do not readily laugh at just any witticism. Strive to have everyone figured out. Never reveal your secrets to anyone; fish for the secrets of others. Say or do nothing indecorous in the presence of anyone, even if it is natural and not malicious, because such things are despised by others.

Preserve modesty with a steady gait, but otherwise keenly observe everything with sharp eyes and a wise brow to give the appearance of curiosity. Such people are considered prudent, astute, and precise.

### Learn About Others

Much can be learned about someone in sickness, drunkenness, when money is involved and gain or loss is at stake, in games and while traveling - when the doors of the mind are relaxed, the wild beasts more readily emerge from their dens. Also in times of affliction, especially when insulted, etc. These occasions should be observed; in these situations one should interact with those one wishes to know.

It helps greatly to frequent their friends, children, young servants, and attendants, who can easily be bribed with small gifts to reveal much. If you suspect what the other person is thinking, suggest the opposite in conversation, praising it. If he thinks the contrary, he will scarcely be so cautious as to not betray himself by defending it or adding something to show he feels otherwise.

You will recognize what vices someone struggles with by this art: bring up in conversation the vices that most commonly occur and with which your friend is most likely to struggle; he will most fiercely attack and curse the vice with which he himself struggles. Thus preachers are often prone to the very vices they most ardently denounce. Ask for advice on some matter; after a few days, discuss it with the same person, for by God's providence we easily forget lies.

Pretend you have knowledge of some matter and mention it in front of the person you think knows about it; he will reveal his own knowledge by correcting you. See with whom a person associates, for a man is known by the company he keeps, etc. Praise someone or console them in affliction, because in such cases obscure and hidden thoughts burst forth.

Entice someone to tell their life story (which can be done by telling your own, pretending); what wicked deeds they have done to others - from this you will have grounds to reason about the present. But be cautious not to reveal your own. You will test knowledge in this way, e.g. give an epigram to be read; if he praises it excessively and it is actually poor, he is a man of little poetic ability. If he praises it insofar as it is praiseworthy, he is a poet. Likewise bring up the subject of food and you will recognize a glutton. The same holds for other vices and virtues. Have someone propose at a gathering, as if in jest, what each person's abilities are, what virtues they have, what office they are suited for - for often jests weave much truth. You can also sometimes play the doctor, mixing things into the food that will make them cheerful and talkative, etc.

It is a sign of a malicious man to frequently contradict; one who often stoops to theft is like this. Those who boast much about themselves are not greatly to be feared; they are fantasizers. Those who are scrupulous, gloomy, say many vocal prayers, have excessively short fingernails, and practice external mortifications without internal ones are also fantasizers. You will recognize one raised from poverty if he starts to complain about food and clothing, for the poor, when elevated, especially desire such things above the nobility. Those devoted to wine and Venus rarely keep secrets, because they are slaves to their mistress; the former are carried away by inconsiderate speech.

You will catch out a braggart and boaster in this way: while he is enumerating his journeys, travels, military service, exploits, how many years he spent in this or that place - then add up the total of all the years; on another occasion ask him what year he began this, what year he finished. How many years his life spans - a great inconsistency will be evident. Also ask if he knows how many towers that famous city has, or that most celebrated fortress (make up a name) - or congratulate him, as if knowing everything, that he escaped this or that danger.

You will recognize an upright man and his piety if consistency is observed in his life; if ambition and the desire for a higher position are absent; if his modesty is not affected and his composure in all things is not contrived; if his speech is not effeminate and excessive outward mortification is not displayed by drinking or eating too little, etc. Those who most boast of being free from ambition and pride, and who act in an overly friendly manner when offended, are by nature melancholic or phlegmatic. Those who have an affected gentleness, a little bump on the nose, and sharp eyes are usually cunning. Ask for advice from someone and his prudence, skill, etc. will be recognized.

Hence one should also pretend to be of two minds and uncertain. Put little trust in one who promises easily, for he is a liar and deceiver. Judge someone to be a keeper of secrets if he never reveals the secrets of another to you out of any friendship - and so suborn such a person to entrust something to him, or to seek from him what you have entrusted: but they are more apt to disclose things to women, children, their beloved, and those they love as superior to themselves. If he reveals someone else's secret to you, entrust him with nothing, because he may have someone he loves as much as you.

It will sometimes be helpful to intercept, reread and respond to the letters of one's subjects. Those who have too many particular and elegant possessions are effeminate and often not very holy. Those who have excessively ornate weapons are often poor soldiers; those with overly refined tools of their trade are often poor craftsmen, unless youth excuses it. Likewise, those who indulge their own nature too much and are excessively handsome and likeable are often unlearned. You will detect a flatterer in this way: pretend you have done something that is clearly absurd and boast about it. If he praises it, he is a flatterer; if not, if at least he remains silent.

You will notice a false friend if a third party, instructed by you, reports to him that you have been reduced to the utmost extremity, that the laws on which you relied have been found to be false; if he hears this as if unconcerned, he will never be a friend. Also send someone to seek advice from him in your name and at the same time ask for help; you will see what kind of person he is. And having tested his proven virtue, pretend that everything was falsely reported to you. The uneducated betray themselves by excessive elegance in their possessions, by the decoration of their walls, by their fastidiousness about their bed, or if something is said that is less than pure Latin, they laugh and show they noticed it.

Beware of men of small stature; they are obstinate, factious, etc. You will test the harmony between friends in this way: disparage one of them by name in front of the other; then praise him - from the silence or lukewarm response you will discern the whole matter. Propose some cases in a group setting, how one could proceed ingeniously in this or that situation; each person's cleverness and cunning will be evident from their response. Also suggest how this or that person could be deceived; bring up the subject of persecutions.

He who says the most will prove he has suffered the most. Liars are often by nature those who have dimples in their cheeks when they laugh. Do not greatly fear those who are excessively concerned with their own skin. Much can be learned about any matter from the young and the very old. One who speaks both well and ill of the same matter is a dissembler - an occasion should be given for this. Those who know many languages are often of poor judgment, because an excess of memory often hinders judgment. If someone suddenly displays great virtues, having previously been wicked, be suspicious. If you think someone will betray your words, speak some unique things in front of him, things you have said in front of no one else; if the saying is spread, you have found the informer. If others tell you their dreams, ask the frequent dreamer about different dreams, and after some discussion you will learn much about his secret mind.

For example, if someone says he loves you, on another occasion fish for dreams; if he never dreams of you, his love is feigned. Explore another's feelings toward you by showing your efforts, or by pretending to be his enemy. Show no knowledge of any vice, and do not relate the vices of others with censure or excessive zeal, or you will be judged to labor under the same ones. If an accuser comes to you, intending to betray another, pretend you have already heard it, and many other things besides; then you will see what suspicions and particulars he will add that he would not otherwise have said.

Those who act too tenderly with dogs and pleasant children are soft. Those who speak with a fake voice and a fake cough are effeminate, prone to lust; so too are those who are excessively well-groomed, adorned, desiring to please the eyes of others, and too observant of a younger or more feminine age. Deceivers are those who concede everything too easily, who excessively approve of all your actions, because this friendship is feigned. Beware of associating with one who inveighs too fiercely against others in your presence, because he will do the same to you.

Catch a keeper of secrets in this way: tell him something under the strictest secrecy; tell the same thing to another with the same caution; set up a third party, aware of the deception, to convene these two and insinuate something about what was entrusted. Here it will appear what each one will betray, and who will betray it first. If they realize all three of them know something together, the one who does not betray it then - make him your secretary.

To learn another's mind, suborn someone whom he loves, and through him you will discover his most secret thoughts.

## Acting in Society

As I begin this part of the discussion, I follow no set order, exploring various contexts.

### Gaining Favor

Determine what matters your friend cares about and tailor your gifts to his interests. Suitable items include mathematics books, optical instruments, microscopes, sundials, various mirrors, and other curiosities, as well as secrets of nature, of which *Mizaldus* offers many. Speak with him often, consult him, and ask for his advice, then follow it. But never lay yourself so bare that if he becomes your enemy, he can use it against you. Ask nothing of him that would be difficult to grant, especially where it touches upon issues of property or money. Congratulate him briefly but elegantly on feast days, birthdays, good health, etc.

Rarely mention his virtues but always overlook his vices. Share your travels with him, relate praises others have spoken of him, and whisper everything in his ear, especially things said by his superiors. Never reveal his demerits or vices, no matter how much he may ask. If he urges you, believing you do not trust him, relate at most the mildest faults, or those he has openly acknowledged himself. For such things leave a bitter memory, no matter how they are said, especially if there is too much truth in them.

Send him frequent greetings through others and in your own letters. Never defend an opinion contrary to his, or if you have dared to differ, allow him to persuade you. Show that you have been swayed and conceal that you disagreed. Be liberal in giving him titles and eagerly offer services you will never need to fulfill. Do not seek to please anyone through their vices, or even through qualities that conflict with your status. If you are a clergyman, avoid excessive jesting, scurrility, deep drinking, etc. While these may win affection in the moment, they will eventually lead to contempt, ridicule, or even fierce hatred, though it may not arise immediately.

Therefore, even if at times it may be expedient to stray beyond the bounds of virtue, let it be done without vice. When you arrive somewhere new, first determine who enjoys the favor of the master of the place and who has influence through factions and eloquence. Win their favor by any means, so that you may use their advice and influence in promoting matters, for they will take some of the burden upon themselves when they give counsel. If you wish to take revenge on someone, make him appear suspect to them and turn their envy to your cause.

Never commit any crime at your master's behest, for even if you win his gratitude in the moment, he will thereafter view you as a critic, one who could act against him as readily as you accepted his unjust command - a man who sold his faithful service and virtue, or at least parted from the reward for the deed as soon as it was done. Write some letters praising a third party and allow them to be lost and intercepted so they reach that third party.

Many judge what pleases them will also please others; therefore they act accordingly. You should instead prudently explore what is pleasing or displeasing to the other person. Address even your inferiors as brothers and preempt them with honors, provided they are of good character. Never provide pleasing things to the point of satiety, lest you induce nausea. Leave them wanting more, whether in games, conversation, etc. Never borrow from a friend, for if he cannot grant what you ask, it is offensive, and he will hate you; or if he reluctantly agrees, or receives back less than whole, he will resent it. Never buy from a friend, for if he sells dearly, you will be harmed; if cheaply, he will be.

Treat even his lowliest servants well, otherwise they will gradually turn your friend's mind against you. Observe this at banquets: Contrive secrets and entrust them as secrets, even those that pertain to his office. Show that you take special care for them. If you deal familiarly with servants, they will hold you in contempt; if angrily, they will hate you; but with gentle gravity, they will revere you.

With free men, show benevolence, love, and courtesy. Do not allow them to stoop to humble services or extreme gestures of submission, such as kissing feet. Consider the greedy as equivalent to servants. If you seek the favor of the people, promise to promote their interests, especially those that benefit individuals, for they are moved more by these than by honor. If invited to dine with inferiors, accept, find no fault in anything, surpass them all in civility while preserving your dignity, and at least be liberal in your words. Take care not to take or appropriate anything of theirs against their will.

Frequently show compassion, console, and bestow favors in stages. Despise nothing, but rather praise. If you must contradict, do not accuse them of imprudence or ignorance. After praising their reasoning and good intentions, point out the disadvantages and costs that would follow. Always show yourself a champion of the people's freedoms. Observe the friend whose favor you wish to gain - is he given to arms or to learning, to clemency or to ferocity?

Rarely act as an intercessor, for whatever is done for others on your account is taken from you, and your favor with the ruler will not remain intact. Keep the ruler wholly for yourself. Reveal no one's secrets to another, for you will then be of little worth to him. If he commands you to commit a crime, delay, and think of a way to excuse yourself. Feign illness, stolen horses, etc. First win over the servants of one whose friendship you seek, even bribing them with gold if necessary - they will draw over their master.

However far you advance in his favor, act as if you were still seeking it through a thousand kindnesses. For favor, once acquired, wishes to be maintained so as not to be lost - indeed, it must be nourished with good offices.

### Knowing Who is Someone's Friend

Praise someone; if the other person is silent, he will not be a friend. Or if he diverts the conversation elsewhere, or speaks halfheartedly and reluctantly, or diminishes the praise, or says the story is inconsistent, or attributes part of the praise to others: Also, if he is aware of some praiseworthy deed but adds nothing to what you say that could augment it.

Or if he says it was a chance occurrence, or attributes it to God's extraordinary providence, and extols that others have done equal or greater things, or that it was done by the counsel of another.

Forge letters in a friend's name to him, in which you ask for something to be entrusted - a favorable disposition, or the opposite, will be evident.

Greet him in a friend's name, or say you heard ill of him, and see what he will add to these things.

### Gaining Esteem and Reputation

Never feel certain that someone will keep a secret if you act or speak too freely or confidently in their presence, not even a child or servant. Instead, they will judge you by this action and describe you as such to others.

Never assume that someone will excuse your questionable action. In fact, they will interpret it in the worst light. Therefore, do not allow yourself anything, even with only one witness.

Do not relate how you were previously defamed or wronged, for you will only defame yourself further and there will be those who approve.

The saying of Bernard does not apply here: "Excuse the intention if you cannot excuse the deed", so that they may say you sinned by accident or thoughtlessly, or that you solicited evil to test them.

At times, especially with talkative people, confidently entrust a secret and ask that they not reveal it to others, namely that you have great influence with the powerful, have correspondence with others, etc. Then, avoiding being seen by others, write letters to such powerful people, seal them, and show that you are then burning the replies which you, however, carelessly keep.

What some hear only partially, they also distort. Thus, if anything like this happens, it must be read carefully.

Boast that you have never harmed anyone. If you did something for someone, certainly for this person, say that you expect a crown from God, and give examples invented on the spot.

Whatever is to be made public (even if it is the smallest thing), do it as perfectly as possible, because often an eternal opinion depends on a single act.

Never take on many things at once, because there is no glory in doing many things, but only if one thing is perfected. I attest from experience.

It is always proper and useful to yield to the angry, the powerful, and relatives. Feign humility of mind, candor, generosity, and cheerfulness. Praise, give thanks, and readily offer yourself, even to the undeserving.

The beginnings of things should be done with the highest counsel and labor, and with all certainty of success. As the first things go, so go all things, and fame once gained will coalesce errors themselves into glory.

If there is something you are obligated to do by your office, do not take it on at anyone's request, as it will diminish your intention toward the work you owe. Be certain that respect is diminished, however much you have done and however many cares distracted you, if you were even slightly lacking in your duty, or even by the very fact that you took them on.

If you are going to negotiate affairs, do not admit a partner who is suitable and more practiced in them than you. If you are going to approach someone, do not have with you one who is more acceptable. If you are going to change office, do not allow notably better successors.

Have those things which are decorations to your house printed without type, spurning detraction at present, for however truthfully and obsequiously they were written, they will be read as probable in the future. But the words of those speaking either with them or before them die.

You will establish a reputation for knowledge in this way: From historical sciences, whatever you can obtain, put in one little book, and when you have leisure each month, reread it. Thus you will imprint the appearances of all things, and when necessary, you will show knowledge.

Have many prepared formulas for responding, greeting, speaking, and whatever must be done suddenly.

Some debase themselves too much, so that they may thereby be extolled, or so that they may seem to be carried by fortune, not by cares; by talent, not by labor. They begin to neglect and despise themselves, or often persuade so that they may be considered inert and weak. Allow those devoted to religion to do this.

Never act to the full extent of your power, so that you may be believed to be unable to do anything more.

What you can do, correct, or punish through servants, do not do yourself. You do the greater things.

Do not dispute uncertain things, unless you know you will certainly win.

If you arrange a banquet, share your fortune with the servants of the guests. This is a talkative crowd, more powerful for infamy; hence a favor should fill the eyes, lest they speculate about other things. Similarly, deal generously with the barber and the prostitute.

### Finding More Time for Business

Delegate minor tasks to others.

Prescribe for yourself an exact order, which you should never transgress. Allot the smallest parts of time to the smallest matters, and do not linger on any task longer than necessary to complete it properly.

If you are fatigued by work, do not undertake anything further, but refresh yourself with honest play and physical activity. Afterwards, you will accomplish more, and more easily, in a short time. Or at least take on a task that you can handle without effort.

Tasks that must be drawn out over several days are best separated, so that you may dispatch them. Do not take on tasks that yield little profit or glory, yet require much labor. For the sake of no one should you engage in useless tasks that demand much time.

Do not deal personally with craftsmen, manage household affairs, gardens, or buildings. These are full of labors and draw care from care.

### Acquiring Gravity

Undertake suitable occupations, such as not handling weapons if you are a Prelate; not practicing chiromancy if you are a Nobleman; not practicing Medicine if you are Religious; and not being a fencing-master if you are a Priest.

Do not easily make promises or concessions. Do not easily laugh or quickly conclude matters. Do not change what has been decided. Do not fix your eyes on another. Do not wrinkle your nose or forehead. Do not be sullen. Make few gestures. Keep your head erect. Use few and sententious words. Do not take excessively wide steps. Compose all of your limbs with decorum.

Do not admit to anyone that you love, hate, or fear anything. Do not personally handle base matters, and do not speak of them. Let no one be present when you are at the table, going to bed, or getting up. Have few friends and deal with them rarely, lest you be held in contempt.

Do not engage in conversation indiscriminately in any place. Do not suddenly change your habits, even for the better, nor your dress, your way of living, your splendor, etc. In praise and blame, one should abstain from excessive exaggeration. Judge in proportion to the matter, lest you become grave through hyperbole. Rarely make your excessive affections, such as delights, admirations, etc., manifest.

Even in the most intimate friendship, display piety. Likewise, when you act with the greatest confidence, do not complain about anyone or accuse anyone. Do not command your subordinates to do many things at once and things they cannot carry out. They will learn to despise commands or will be able to show they were imprudently ordered.

Make no laws, or very few. Do not be quick to anger, for if you are then quick to be appeased, you will be considered fickle. If you are going to say something publicly, meditate beforehand and speak from a written text.

### Reading and Writing

If you are writing in a place that many people frequent, raise up the written paper as if you were copying it. Let this be visible to everyone, while what you are truly writing lies hidden, covered in such a way that only the line you have copied is visible and can be read by anyone approaching. Cover what you have written in a book or another sheet of paper, or move the raised paper closer. If someone approaches while you are reading, immediately turn many pages so your focus is not detected. In fact, it is best to have several books combined, so that one may be presented for inspection before another.

If you are writing letters or reading a book and someone arrives in whose presence reading would make you suspect, foresee this and propose something completely different from the book and letters, as if reading from them. For example, if you are writing warnings, ask the approaching guest what you could cautiously and prudently respond to such a case, or ask for news so you could fill the letters. Do the same when counting money or reading a book.

Write secrets in your own hand only if you are writing in ciphers, and ones that can be read and understood by everyone, like those Trithemius gave in his *Polygraphia*. These conceal more if written by another's hand. Ciphers that cannot be read arouse suspicion and interception, unless you write skillfully.

### Giving Gifts and Favors

Be generous in giving what you know others will not ask for, or what they will never use, such as privileges. A teacher should not instruct his student so thoroughly that the student no longer hopes to learn more. Nor should a parent give so much to his child that the child either does not need any favors or cannot hope for anything more. The same applies to a master with respect to his servant. If lands are given, they should be of a kind that require the master's goodwill, for instance lacking wood, water, or mills.

If a contract or deed is drawn up, a clause should be included making it revocable at the master's discretion. If someone is worthy of a common office and declines it when you confer it on him, do not allow him to refuse under any circumstances; unless it is publicly known that he has done this. Otherwise, it will be believed that you did not adequately compensate his merits; so that he cannot excuse himself, confer it when it must be immediately administered, and meanwhile be absent, so that he is compelled to inquire about the appointment and begin his duties in the meantime.

A favor should be granted in such a way that you lose nothing by it, for instance by forgiving due penalties as a reward, or new taxes that you would otherwise have imposed less justly, following the example of your neighbors. The things you use yourself, such as weapons, horses, rings, should not be too costly, so that you can give them away as a great gift at little cost to yourself. When giving gifts, avoid common methods. For instance, to give a rifle, have a contest with a prize for hitting a target, then give it to the winner as if already victorious. Or certainly decide on the matter, or rig the game.

If you wish to give something pleasing to a particular person, do not promise it, because then they will decline it politely, or at least buy it with entreaties. Those who praise their own possessions in front of others are inviting them to ask for those things. Do not readily condemn what predecessors have established; they foresaw things you do not notice. Likewise, do not readily grant perpetual favors, because it may be necessary to change them later, and you will no longer be able to do so.

Do not appear to throw away gifts, nor try to increase their value so that they may be pleasing. Consider what needs someone is compelled by, and when; and if you have benefited others, do not tell this to others; you will offend them and seem to be reproaching them. And if you are forced to mention it, say it was a debt, and that you do not need or wish to accept thanks for it. If something is given to you (even if very small), take care not to be ungrateful.

### Asking for Things

See that what you ask for does not strain the purse or demand much labor, and it will be enough to indicate to a friend that you are in need of this thing. For if he does not provide it then, he will not do so at your entreaty either. But show yourself grateful for what has been provided, so that he may notice that by this very act you are requesting more.

If you are about to request something serious, discuss other matters and explain your desires as if doing something else. Be cautious when asking nobles, because they think they are being ordered. Bring in intercessors, the most illustrious persons, such as offspring to a parent, as long as you do not employ those who are in need of the same thing.

The time to ask is when someone is happy, which is on a feast day and after a meal, but not while he is drowsy, nor amid other business when he is distracted, nor when afflicted by sleep. And do not presume to ask for many things at once. When taking up someone's cause to promote, favor him as if he were unknown. Have rare meetings with him, so that you may seem to be moved more by honest and public affection than private.

Propose reasons and advantages to the persons with whom you are dealing: profits and losses to the greedy; the glory of God to spiritual men; praises to the young; and mockery from companions. Do not ask a leader for privileges and charters, for such things are granted slowly. But at an opportune time, submit the written documents for him to sign.

Do not ask another for something if he is fond of it (especially if it is useless to you), some rare thing. For if he refuses, he will think you have injured him and will hate you, for it is human to hate the one you have injured. If he grants it, he will shun you as an indiscreet petitioner. Because it is shameful to suffer rejection, ask for nothing unless you are certain of obtaining it. Therefore it will be better not to ask, but only to explain the necessity.

Let no one notice that you love the thing you desire before you are in possession of it. Therefore, either show despair or spread the rumor that it has already been destined for another, and congratulate him. If something is denied to you, secretly send another to request it for himself, from whom you will more easily obtain the thing. If someone wants to snatch from you an honor that you seek, send someone to him who will dissuade him in the name of friendship and show the difficulties.

### Admonishing

Begin by relating other matters, then exaggerate and condemn the deeds about which you wish to admonish, adding other circumstances, lest the listener realize he is being rebuked. Often tell the listener to be of good mind and cheerful, mixing in jests. If he becomes sad, ask the cause, then at the end append everything else, even speaking about remedies in the abstract.

If someone knows he is suspected by you of some vice, put him in charge of secret matters, but not with risk. In order not to remove your suspicion of him, he will carry out the task with his whole heart. Therefore, it is sometimes expedient to show yourself as suspicious.

If you reprove headstrong youths who fall into illicit acts, you will only inflame them more. Therefore, it is better to await their repentance or satiety.

If it happens that you must change tactics, do not abruptly shift from harsh to gentle. With the cold, one must act openly and incite fear; with the fervent, act cautiously and gently.

### Avoiding Deception

Give moderate trust to prudent men, because they too greatly understate what concerns their prerogatives; and because they put too favorable an interpretation on the reputation of others. They will not admit if anyone has spoken ill of you in their presence, nor from whom you should beware, nor with what vices they struggle. The same is true of priests when they praise their penitents, because they can say nothing but good about them, no less than parents about their children.

From one you fear may make complaints against you, raise a disturbance, or do something similar in your absence - keep him with you under the guise of friendship, in entertainments, hunting, at table, in conversation, in military service, etc. Thus, to prevent neighboring nations from rebelling while you are entangled in another war, bring their leading men with you to the war with a small force, from which no treachery can be feared, as if they were most faithful.

It will be useful to have a mirror in front of you while you sit at table or write, so that you may see what is being done behind your back.

### Preserving Health

Pay attention here to avoid deficiencies or excesses in food, in terms of both quantity and quality, as well as in clothing with respect to heat and cold. Avoid distress in sleep, work, and location, and do not praise places that are excessively high. Repletion and evacuation are the sources of diseases; let motion and rest be moderate, and the passions of the mind not unbridled. Do not dwell near swamps or even rivers.

The windows of your bedroom should face more to the North and East than to the South. One should not pursue serious business for more than two hours at a time, but at intervals allow for some relaxation of the mind. Foods should be well-prepared and such that they can be obtained anywhere.

Use Venus moderately in whatever state you remain, and do so according to the requirements of your own constitution.
