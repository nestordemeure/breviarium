# Brief Political Summaries, According to the Mazarin Rubrics

## The Printer to the Reader

The Italian Prince who had sent me this political treatise to be published had been so occupied with urgent affairs that I delayed printing it. Now, at the command of the same most excellent Prince, I make it public. The worthiness of the material and the name of the most eminent Cardinal Mazarin, whose life and standards were the model and norm for what is here proposed, will add a significant weight to the usual political rules. That the most eminent Prince was immersed in serious crises, and almost overwhelmed, is known to all. However, the arts by which he overcame the various torrents of adversity, by which he seemed destined to be engulfed, and by which he most successfully reached the haven of safety, are not so readily apparent to everyone. It is challenging to extract how, during those perilous and difficult times, he applied his greatest efforts in the administration of a very powerful kingdom, torn by various factional parts, emerged gloriously from many diverse difficulties, and — not insignificantly — had imbued *Louis XIV*, the greatest of all Kings of France, with those ruling precepts before he took the helm, by which, taking the reins of the kingdom, he greatly expanded the boundaries of France and raised it to the highest peak of dignity and power. This treatise will ease this burden for you, and while there exists scarcely a complete and perfect system of political precepts, and the particular circumstances which greatly modify general rules are infinite, therefore no easier or more successful method can be imparted than if we adapt those general rules to those particular circumstances upon which they depend, making a discipline laden only with general precepts from theoretical to practical or active. You, kind reader, will more easily fulfill this wish if you strive to observe this illustrious example, to which today's Politicians, as political leaders and pioneers, adapt themselves and adjust their rules with their prudence: Yet, act in such a way that you are indeed aware of the reasons and norms used by political men, not however to deceive, but so you are not deceived, combining both these norms of utmost prudence, which both the general rule of equity and justice and the Gospel command prescribe: *Do unto others as you would have them do unto you, Be wise as serpents and harmless as doves.*

Furthermore, the Art of Reconciling Spirits, included here, taken from the most blameless and clearest sources of celebrated Political Doctrine, carries every point.

Enjoy our work, and farewell.

## Where Talent Must Be Cultivated

Above all, it is necessary to estimate one's talent, what it can and cannot do, to follow the seeds of our nature unless we wish to waste both wealth and age along with effort. Choose instructors suited to the customs of this age, whose character and teaching we should emulate, who know how to mold us according to the morals of the current times.

Let not religion deter you from entrusting yourself or your dependents to them: it is a kind of superstitious persuasion, a flaw of a certain nation, highly estimated by a Political man who seeks to achieve his end.

### On the Method of Studies

They will educate you in the Latin language: the style of composing modern political poetry or various praises, which contributes much to becoming renowned, they will teach you, where you must apply utmost care to stand out among the learned, even occasionally admit to public declamations, speeches, and small theatrical performances, to not only observe but also imitate the behaviors and gestures of others: from this, you will acquire incredible audacity, especially necessary for a politician, so that you do not shy away from conversing and interacting with individuals of some honor. Devote yourself entirely to philosophy, which includes logic, physics, metaphysics, ethics, politics, and mathematics, under which also fall arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and geography; however, do not forget steganography, the delights of mathematics, the art of memory, and similar arts, but especially after others, give attention to these, by which you can make yourself agreeable to all; nothing so occupies the minds of people and paves the way for advancement, especially among the great, as regal and divine mathematics, especially optics, unless one knows the method, they might easily say it consists of magical arts and deceptions of the devil.

### On the Study of Studies

Afterwards, when you have acquired a general, if not refined and distinct, then at least a somewhat confused knowledge of any arts whatsoever, so that you may discuss any subject of knowledge, the crux of the matter lies in cultivating one science or art, and cultivating it to such an extent that you find very few equals.

This is achieved (I) by reading not many authors, but those exquisite in that science, retaining what has been read, which will be of no small help to you, especially by reducing the main and most notable points to commonplaces, because by this practice you will subject the contents of many books to your eyes and mind at almost a single glance.

Then by associating with the learned, observing their speeches, manners, and methodical reasons: because if you converse daily with equals, no benefit will emanate from them.

Finally, if it happens that someone mentions some knowledge, problem, or art of which you have no knowledge or only imperfect knowledge, you should immediately contradict him, alleging impossibility and falsehood, and refute whatever he says; in this way, he will explain his mind to you, add reasons, remove difficulties, and thus not only will you learn what you did not know before, but you will also retain it more strongly because you previously contradicted it.

For it is the nature of the most learned men not to allow themselves to be suppressed, but to defend and protect their opinion and belief against those who contradict them with all effort, labor, and industry.

### On the Religion of a Political Man

Every Christian man is obliged to choose a single religion for himself, such a one as he believes conducive to his beatitude, and to inscribe and impress it upon his mind and soul so that only God and he himself know it: for truly only the divine being should know the true religion of a Political man, but the Political man must adhere to his religion in such a way that he is internally devoted to it, yet externally, before others, if the necessity of time and place demands it, he should always learn to simulate and dissimulate in matters indifferent without any mark of frivolity.

For an open religion often impedes a political man from achieving his political end.

### Internal Character

With such instruction, utmost care must be taken in which ways it is suitable for a man to be a Politician of these times.

He should be restrained in speech, not rashly or in vain utter whatever comes to his mouth: let no word escape unless it pleases others or can be of benefit to himself.

Nor let him be so much a Politician and tenacious of truth as to learn early to feign like a spider artfully, whatever makes for his benefit.

He should not easily betray the words or deeds of others unless he hopes for benefit from it.

He should restrain all passions, simulate, and learn to conceal his own desires; nothing so harms, and has harmed, a Political man as an open spirit, a tongue prodigal of truth, and a revealer of plans.

For silence is the safest bond of managing affairs: hence no one can bear serious matters who finds it difficult to keep silent.

Therefore, let the Politician beware lest he frequently inquire about various matters from others, especially those that do nothing for his benefit, for from this arises a suspicion of loquacity among the Wise, according to that saying: Avoid the inquirer, for he is talkative.

Furthermore, a true Politician should rather benefit others than himself, but so that it neither harms him, and if something to be made public, from which he might hunt profit, let him artfully use others secretly for it, or by whatever other means he can. From this, he will have the advantage of occupying the minds of those with whom he must necessarily live.

He should beware of the company of many, beware of excessive familiarity with equals, especially inferiors, from whom he gains nothing but contempt, and occasionally differing opinions, which the Politician should forget rather than remember.

If he does this, it will benefit him to such an extent that no one will easily judge about him.

The Politician should explore the minds of others rather than them his; indeed, the Politician should learn to judge speciously, by which he deceiving others, yet himself obtains the love and benefit of all, and is deceived by no one in actions aimed at honor and dignity, not swear unless compelled by necessity, not excuse himself except before a judge and future arbiter. Before superiors, either be, or deserve to be believed, obtain favor and clemency, and remove every suspicion of treachery: in doubtful matters, he rarely purges himself of a crime alleged by accusers, who has the mark of levity.

In public councils, consultations, and conversations, let not the Politician contradict, but subscribe to all, praise everyone, and especially diligently accommodate himself to the genius of others.

*Faithful to none, affable to all, he deceives all;*
*The court welcomes such a man in the foremost place.*

Thus it happens that they trust his mind, reveal secrets, and admit the Political man into the more confidential deliberations, from which, with arbiters removed, he draws what is to his advantage: and if something yet needs to be done that offends others, whether in public or private, let him not do it himself but through others.

Therefore, let the Politician always have shameless, ambitious, and sometimes seditious men, whose company is easily obtained, use their efforts secretly so that if anything is done wrong, their rashness rather than his (o Politics!) cunning is attributed to it, and especially if you can so clandestinely manage and moderate your actions that if the counsels and persuasions you supplied to others fall out adversely, you can immediately interpret them any way you like according to your judgment.

Do nothing unless you have thoroughly shaken out the circumstances beforehand, propose the end maturely, foresee the future, do not commit your actions to fortune, but strive to achieve your end by art or simulation. And if thus you cautiously handle the matter alone, the matter itself suggests other modes of deceiving, achieving glory, honor, benefit with public favor, and this creates admiration if you can foresee or predict something unknown to others.

### External Character

Above all, see that your manners are acceptable to others, that you adapt your suspicions, speech, and gestures to suit, simulating everything to capture them, so you do not fall into suspicion of flattery or assentation, especially before Princes, for as contempt is conciliated among equals, so not rarely is hatred among Princes. In the courts of Princes, one must play the parasite, hear much, speak little. The Politician must sometimes be no less stocked with jokes and stories than with wise counsels. If necessity demands, do not refuse drinks, indeed sometimes invite the Prince more generously, especially when you hope for some benefit, thus avoiding the vice of the flatterer, you will converse well with the Prince, and let the Prince not explore your mind, be cunning and versatile. Today you will converse boldly with no one unless you have thoroughly understood that person's character.

### Manners with Equals and Inferiors

Live with others in such a way that utmost kindness appears in your face, words, and gestures, offer yourself ready and prompt for studies, services, which, however, are done without your harm.

Beware, lest you be so prodigal in promises that your ability prevents fulfillment; but moderate such benevolent affection, so that they expect more from you in the future than they demand in the present; for if you promise more than you deliver, you will incur suspicion of levity, which causes hatred.
