You are an expert editor with a knack for producing clear, well-flowing texts.

This is an excerpt from an English translation of Mazarin's `Breviarum Politicorum, Secundum Rubricas Mazarinicas`:

```md

Does the translation appear easy to read and understand for a contemporary audience (it is targeted at a wide audience and not just specialists)? Some formulations, terms, or sentence structures might be hard to grasp, unclear, or refer to unspecified elements.

Provide a list of passages that require further work, as well as suggested fixes or requests for clarifications. Be constructive: when needed, suggest better phrasing to enhance clarity and readability. Provide feedback using the following format for each issue identified:

```
* "Original sentence"
  * Problem: [Brief description of the issue with the original sentence.]
  * Suggestion: [Your suggested rephrased sentence.]
```

Note that this is a 17th-century text: it contains stereotypes, outdated views, and unethical suggestions. These are fine, as our reader will have further context with the text, and they are not to be edited out.
