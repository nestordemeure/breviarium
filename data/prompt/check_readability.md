Does the translation appear easy to read and understand for a contemporary audience (it is targeted at a wide audience and not just specialists)? Some formulations, terms, or sentence structures might be hard to grasp, unclear, or refer to unspecified elements.

If you believe that the translation reads well, write "Readable.". Otherwise, provide a list of passages that you believe would require further work as well as suggested fixes or requests for clarifications.
