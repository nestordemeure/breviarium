This is an excerpt from an English translation of Mazarin's `Breviarum Politicorum, Secundum Rubricas Mazarinicas`:

Does the translation appear easy to read and understand for a contemporary audience (it is targeted at a wide audience and not just specialists)? Some formulations, terms, or sentence structures might be hard to grasp, unclear, or refer to unspecified elements.

If you believe that the translation reads well, write "Readable."

Otherwise, provide a list of passages that require further work, as well as suggested fixes or requests for clarifications. Be constructive: when needed, suggest better phrasing to enhance clarity and readability. Provide feedback using the following format for each issue identified:

```
* "Original sentence"
  * Problem: [Brief description of the issue with the original sentence.]
  * Suggestion: [Your suggested rephrased sentence.]
```
