This Latin excerpt is a section of the 1684 print of Mazarin's `Breviarum Politicorum, Secundum Rubricas Mazarinicas`:

$LATIN

This is the corresponding translation to English:

```md
$ENGLISH
```

I am afraid that text has been added or removed to the English translation.

Check the translation (especially the beginning and end of the section, this is where addition / deletion are the most likely) and tell me if the English matches with the Latin or not.

If the translation appears correct, display "Matching". Otherwise, provide a fixed translation. Either way, put your answer in <response></response> tags.
