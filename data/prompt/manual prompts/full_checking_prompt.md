I am giving you a Latin text (written in 1684 by Mazarin) as well as an English translation.

I am afraid that text has been added or removed to the English translation.

Check section per section (especially the beginning and end of the section, this is where addition / deletion are the most likely) and tell me if the English matches with the Latin or not.

Display a bullet list of section title with either "Matching." or a short explanation of the mismatch.
