I am giving you two OCRs of the 1701 print of Mazarin's `Breviarum Politicorum, Secundum Rubricas Mazarinicas`.

The book is structured as follows:

```md
$INDEX
```

Your task is to clean up the `$HEADING` section (the FULL section: up to, and excluding the `$NEXT-HEADING` section).

Put the corresponding Latin in <latin></latin> tags. Use modern Latin standards, such as substituting 's' for 'f', clarifying 'u/v' and 'i/j' ambiguities, and standardizing orthography for consistency with contemporary usage.
Using appropriate markdown features such as lists, emphasis, etc., where applicable.

Do not include the title of the section.
