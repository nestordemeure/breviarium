I am giving you two OCRs of the 1701 print of Mazarin's `Breviarum Politicorum, Secundum Rubricas Mazarinicas`.

The book is structured as follows:

```md
$INDEX
```

Your task is to clean up the `$HEADING` section (the FULL section: up to, and excluding the `$NEXT-HEADING` section).

Use modern Latin standards, such as substituting 's' for 'f', clarifying 'u/v' and 'i/j' ambiguities, ASCII character set, and standardizing orthography for consistency with contemporary usage.
Using appropriate markdown features such as emphasis, etc., where applicable.

Do not include the title of the section. Put your response in <response></response> tags.
