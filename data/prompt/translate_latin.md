I am giving you the text of the 1684 print of Mazarin's `Breviarum Politicorum, Secundum Rubricas Mazarinicas` as well as the ongoing translation to English (all section titles have already been translated).

Your task is to translate the `$HEADING` section (the FULL section: up to, and excluding the `$NEXT-HEADING` section).

Do not include the title of the section. Put your response in <response></response> tags.
