### Learn About Yourself

Here are a few passages that could be improved for clarity and readability:

1. "Are you overcome by anger, fear, rashness, or some other passion? What defects are evident in your conduct, at the table, in church, in conversation, in games, along with other actions, especially social ones?"
   - Consider breaking this into two separate questions for better flow and clarity.
   - Suggestion: "Are you overcome by anger, fear, rashness, or some other passion? What defects are evident in your conduct during various activities, such as dining, attending church, conversing with others, playing games, or engaging in other social interactions?"

2. "With whom do you associate - are they praiseworthy, fortunate, prudent people?"
   - The phrase "fortunate people" might be unclear to some readers.
   - Suggestion: "With whom do you associate? Are they praiseworthy, successful, and prudent individuals?"

3. "At what times are you rendered most incautious - do you stumble in word or deed? At the table when you are drunk? In games, or in calamity? For according to Tacitus, "the minds of mortals are pliable" at such times."
   - The term "incautious" might not be familiar to all readers.
   - The quote from Tacitus could be better integrated into the text.
   - Suggestion: "At what times are you most likely to act carelessly or recklessly? Do you stumble in word or deed when drinking at the table, playing games, or facing calamity? As Tacitus noted, "the minds of mortals are pliable" during such moments."

4. "Mark down each individual defect, so that you may attend to it all the more strictly. It will be beneficial, whenever it happens that you slip up, to impose something rather harsh on yourself."
   - The phrase "impose something rather harsh on yourself" could be clarified.
   - Suggestion: "Make note of each individual defect, so that you may address it more diligently. Whenever you make a mistake, it will be beneficial to discipline yourself strictly."

5. "Preserve modesty with a steady gait, but otherwise keenly observe everything with sharp eyes and a wise brow to give the appearance of curiosity. Such people are considered prudent, astute, and precise."
   - The phrase "wise brow" might be confusing for some readers.
   - Suggestion: "Maintain a modest and steady demeanor, but keenly observe everything with sharp eyes and an inquisitive expression. Those who do so are considered prudent, astute, and precise."
