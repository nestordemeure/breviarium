### Avoiding Ambushes

* "Pretend to have a quarrel with a friend, so that your enemy suspects it is a real quarrel and reveals their true feelings, wishing to take advantage of the situation."
  * Problem: The sentence is long and complex, making it difficult to follow.
  * Suggestion: "Stage a quarrel with a friend to trick your enemy into believing it's real. This may prompt your enemy to reveal their true feelings as they attempt to exploit the situation."

* "Then, suddenly resist and oppose the enemy with your friend's combined strength."
  * Problem: The transition from the previous sentence is abrupt, and the meaning of "suddenly resist and oppose" is unclear.
  * Suggestion: "Once your enemy is convinced, unexpectedly join forces with your friend to confront them together."

* "This will also work against robbers setting an ambush on the road, or in other situations where you know there are ambushes; leave yourself exposed and proceed to where the ambushes will be set in motion against you, then flee and lead them into an ambush."
  * Problem: The sentence is very long and covers multiple scenarios, making it hard to follow.
  * Suggestion: "This tactic can also be used against robbers planning an ambush on the road or in similar situations. Knowingly make yourself vulnerable and approach the ambush site. When the trap is sprung, flee and lure your attackers into a counter-ambush."

* "If a powerful man sets the ambushes, be cautious in your words, so that he does not take open action against you."
  * Problem: The reference to "a powerful man" is unclear, as it hasn't been mentioned before.
  * Suggestion: "If the person setting the ambush is powerful, choose your words carefully to avoid provoking them into taking direct action against you."

* "If some people are persuading you to take an action that may harm you, show enthusiasm and prepare yourself to do it, unless it is difficult to set up."
  * Problem: The phrase "unless it is difficult to set up" is vague and doesn't clearly relate to the rest of the sentence.
  * Suggestion: "If others are urging you to take an action that may be harmful to you, feign enthusiasm and make preparations to comply, as long as the preparations are not too complicated or demanding."

### Acquiring and Retaining Money

1. "Do not be lavish with them, such as allowing pieces of bread, food, or oats for horses to go to waste."
   * Suggestion: "Avoid being wasteful with resources, such as allowing bread, food, or horse feed to go to waste."

2. "Confer with good economists and learn their methods."
   * Clarification needed: The term "economists" might be unclear to a contemporary audience. Consider using "financial experts" or "money managers" instead.

3. "If you are going to incur expenses, first consider by what means you can recover just as much, so that nothing is lost."
   * Suggestion: "Before incurring expenses, consider how you can recover an equal amount, so that you don't lose money overall."

4. "For example, if someone decides to give four thousand scudi to valiant soldiers, he should first announce monetary penalties for gamblers and similar vices, so that the expenditure may be refunded there."
   * Clarification needed: The connection between giving money to soldiers and recovering it through penalties for gamblers might not be immediately clear to readers. Consider providing more context or rephrasing the example.

5. "Do not have precious utensils that perish with use or lose their value, but only enough to suffice for your status, such as silver vessels, in which the workmanship is valued more than the material."
   * Suggestion: "Avoid owning expensive utensils that deteriorate with use or lose their value. Instead, only possess enough to suit your status, such as silver vessels, where the craftsmanship is more valuable than the material itself."

6. "You will detect the deceit of a steward in this way: after he has given an account, as if having forgotten, order him to recite the same things from memory after a few hours. If they are false, he will give inconsistent answers."
   * Suggestion: "To catch a steward's dishonesty, try this method: After he has provided an account, pretend to have forgotten and ask him to repeat the same information from memory a few hours later. If the information is false, his answers will be inconsistent."

### Gaining and Conferring Honors

1. "First persuade that it is necessary to confer honor that is such as you yourself describe through the circumstances." - This sentence is unclear. Consider rephrasing it to clarify the meaning, such as: "First, persuade others that it is necessary to bestow honor in a manner that you yourself define through the circumstances."

2. "Strive for good and clear counsel and do many things that are pleasing to the public, such as the construction of public buildings, toward the poor, and those things that can be done without increasing the sudden taxes." - The phrase "toward the poor" seems out of place. Consider revising to: "Strive for good and clear counsel and do many things that are pleasing to the public, such as the construction of public buildings, providing aid to the poor, and implementing measures that can be done without suddenly increasing taxes."

3. "Do not rely on your talents and worthiness for any duties, as if they must necessarily be conferred on you, and as if there were no one else equally suitable." - The meaning is unclear. Consider rephrasing to clarify the advice being given, such as: "Do not assume that your talents and worthiness automatically qualify you for any duties, as if they must necessarily be conferred upon you and as if there were no one else equally suitable."

4. "If you have an office that requires a powerful person, and there is no one more powerful than you, bestow all of its revenues in perpetuity, so that anyone must bring their strength to it, not find it, and thus it will remain with your house." - This passage is confusing. Consider clarifying the meaning or providing more context.

5. "If you seek virtues, seek them in a high degree; attain the greatest dignities you can, and thus place yourself most securely in all places." - The phrase "place yourself most securely in all places" is vague. Consider rephrasing to clarify the intended meaning.

6. "While fortune favors you, use it, because it easily flees. While you are loved, seek what you can; feign mildness, anger, rewards, and anticipate with honor." - The last part of this passage is unclear. Consider revising to clarify the advice being given, such as: "While fortune favors you, make the most of it, because it can easily change. While you are loved, seek what you can; display mildness, anger, and rewards as needed, and anticipate others with honor."

### Responding to Requests

1. "The nature of the common people is to fly, die, or languish on impulse." - This metaphorical language may be unclear. Consider rephrasing or providing context.

2. "Hence, if they ask for something unjust, do not refuse immediately, but put them off with splendid reasons and some favors." - The term "splendid reasons" is vague. Consider using more specific language or examples.

3. "Allow the hatred of someone to be accepted by you, as it were; in this they are not as false as in love." - The meaning of this sentence is unclear. Consider rephrasing or providing additional context.

4. "If an office cannot be refused to someone, grant one that brings danger to himself and does not disturb the administration of the army in the guise of honor, as the Romans once did by retaining men in the court with honorary duties." - This sentence is long and complex. Consider breaking it into shorter sentences or simplifying the structure.

5. "Proclaim a set time of the year, or at least within three years, for a written catalog concerning servants, through folding doors, while you remove some from their duties, raise others higher, distribute favors, and even lend an ear to some petition." - The term "folding doors" is unclear in this context. Consider providing more information or using a different term.

6. "Announce that if anyone asks through himself, you will grant it, but deny it to him if he arranges it through others. In the future, let everything be denied." - The shift from granting requests to denying everything in the future may be confusing. Consider providing more context or explanation for this change in approach.

### Assuming Various Affections

1. "Compile for yourself examples of affections from the Poets, such as the *Palace of Eloquence* provides, and practice those you need until you have absorbed them."
   * Clarify what "affections" means in this context.
   * Provide more information about the "*Palace of Eloquence*" or consider removing the reference if it's not essential.

2. "Entrust yourself to no one, even your closest friend. You will pretend to do so, but have no less command over your countenance than your words in displaying an affection; no less can be read from the face."
   * Break the second sentence into two shorter sentences for better clarity.
   * Clarify the meaning of "countenance" and "affection" in this context.
   Suggested fix: "Entrust yourself to no one, even your closest friend. You will pretend to do so, but have command over your facial expressions as much as your words when displaying affection. The face can reveal just as much as words."

3. "Master your own timidity, so that, conscious of a matter, you act no less boldly than in similar cases."
   * Clarify the meaning of "conscious of a matter" in this context.
   Suggested fix: "Master your own timidity, so that when you are aware of a situation, you act as boldly as you would in similar cases."

### Feasting

Here are some passages that might benefit from further clarification or rewording for a contemporary, non-specialist audience:

1. "artificial wines, such as *Arnoldus de Villanova* describes" - Clarify who Arnoldus de Villanova is and consider providing a brief explanation of what artificial wines are.

2. "giant eggs composed of many and seasoned with spices" - Clarify what the eggs are composed of (e.g., many smaller eggs or other ingredients).

3. "candles burning from ice" - Explain how this is possible or rephrase to clarify the intended meaning.

4. "fake fragrant fruits, or apples brought to the table on the very branch" - Clarify whether the apples are fake or real, as the sentence seems to contradict itself.

5. "of which *Apicius* offers very many" - Clarify who Apicius is and consider rephrasing to "of which Apicius offers many examples" for clarity.

6. "Have a wheel made of ice, which falls apart on its own." - Provide more context about the purpose or significance of this ice wheel.

7. "Some things should appear that spontaneously change color, disappear and reappear" - Consider providing examples of what these "things" might be to help the reader better understand the concept.

8. "even the vessels in which they are carried can be made, for instance, of fake gems." - Clarify what "they" refers to (cheeses or something else mentioned earlier in the text).

Overall, the passage might benefit from some additional context and explanations to make it more accessible to a wider audience. Breaking up longer sentences and simplifying some of the language could also improve readability.

### Avoiding Losses

Here are a few passages that could be improved for clarity and readability:

1. "Pay attention to even the smallest faults, and have your agents immediately report to you from where any harm may be imminent, so that the need to act is not delayed until it has happened, and at the same time let them suggest a way of averting it."

Suggestion: "Pay attention to even the smallest faults. Have your agents immediately report to you any potential sources of harm, so that you can take action before it occurs. Also, ask them to suggest ways to prevent the harm."

2. "The rates for buying and selling things should be observed, and experts should be consulted about unknown matters."

Clarification needed: What does "rates for buying and selling things" refer to? Is it about monitoring market prices or setting fixed prices for goods?

3. "Each week, have the steward give an account of what has been done, and have one person, after everyone has retired, search the house to see if everything is locked and who is absent."

Suggestion: "Each week, have the steward report on what has been accomplished. Also, after everyone has gone to bed, assign one person to check that the house is locked and note who is absent."

4. "If you hold any office, refer every expense and income, however benevolent the Master may have been, most candidly in the accounts."

Suggestion: "If you hold any office, record all expenses and income in the accounts with complete honesty, regardless of how generous the Master may have been."

### Acting in a Novel Way

Here are a few passages that could be improved for clarity and readability:

1. "At the outset, contemplate four things:" - The term "contemplate" may be unclear to some readers. Consider rephrasing to "At the beginning, consider four things:" or "To start, think about four aspects:"

2. "First, will it be useful to you, or more harmful?" - The "it" is unclear and needs to be specified. Rephrase to something like "First, will this decision/action be useful to you, or more harmful?"

3. "Second, does nature supply you with the gifts for this?" - The term "gifts" in this context may be confusing. Consider rephrasing to "Second, do you have the natural abilities or talents required for this?"

4. "Third, does it suit your status?" - Clarify what "it" refers to and what is meant by "status." For example, "Third, does this decision/action align with your current position or role in life?"

5. "Fourth, are you valued there, where you choose?" - This sentence is a bit unclear. Consider rephrasing to "Fourth, are you respected and appreciated in the environment or situation you are choosing?"

Overall, the main issues are the use of unclear pronouns ("it") and some terms that may be confusing or vague for a general audience. Specifying the context and rephrasing these sentences should improve the readability of the translation.

### Not Losing a Bargain

Here are a few passages that could be improved for better readability and clarity:

1. "If you are betting with someone on the outcome of something, at the same time bet the same amount with another person on the opposite outcome of the same thing, and thus you will lose nothing."
   * Suggestion: "When betting on an outcome, place an equal bet with another person on the opposite result. This way, you will not incur any net loss."

2. "In burdensome contracts, include indeterminate conditions that can be interpreted more broadly or narrowly, e.g. that upon the city's surrender you will preserve everything, if no uprising is incited - do not specify publicly or privately, by your men or others."
   * Suggestion: "When drafting onerous contracts, incorporate ambiguous terms that allow for broad or narrow interpretation. For example, upon a city's surrender, promise to preserve everything if no uprising occurs, without specifying whether this applies to your men or others, or whether the promise is made publicly or privately."

3. "If necessary and fairness demands, you will reject the agreements."
   * Clarification needed: It is unclear what "necessary and fairness demands" refers to. Providing more context or rephrasing the sentence could improve comprehension.

4. "In promises, say "if you do this or that to my satisfaction", etc."
   * Suggestion: "When making promises, include conditional phrases such as "if you perform this task to my satisfaction" or similar stipulations."

5. "It will be easy to demonstrate a defect."
   * Clarification needed: The meaning of "defect" in this context is ambiguous. Providing more information about what kind of defect is being referred to would help readers understand the point being made.

### Covering Mistakes

Here are some passages that could be improved for better readability and clarity:

1. "If you happen to stumble in speech or act thoughtlessly, pretend you said it suddenly to test the judgment of others, or that in expressing one thing you said another."
   * Clarification: It's unclear what "it" refers to in "pretend you said it suddenly."
   * Suggestion: "If you happen to stumble in speech or act thoughtlessly, pretend you spoke deliberately to test the judgment of others, or that you misspoke while trying to express something else."

2. "If you have erred out of ignorance in some matter, do not inquire of anyone in such a way that they notice you are unaware or have erred."
   * Clarification: The phrase "in such a way that they notice you are unaware or have erred" is a bit convoluted.
   * Suggestion: "If you have made a mistake due to ignorance, do not ask others about it in a manner that reveals your lack of knowledge or error."

3. "Also, premeditate how you would seek the truth, or ask another's opinion on what they would do in such a case, while concealing your own, lest you be noticed as ignorant."
   * Clarification: The sentence is quite long and complex, making it harder to follow.
   * Suggestion: "Additionally, plan ahead on how you would seek the truth or ask for others' opinions on what they would do in a similar situation. Be sure to conceal your own opinion to avoid being perceived as ignorant."

4. "Be most cautious in confounding others, for you will betray either your ignorance or intention."
   * Clarification: The meaning of "confounding others" is not immediately clear.
   * Suggestion: "Be extremely cautious when attempting to mislead or confuse others, as you may inadvertently reveal your own ignorance or true intentions."

### Stirring Up Hatred Against Wicked Men

Here are some passages that may require further work to improve readability and clarity for a contemporary, wide audience:

1. "Praise the one you need to be motivated by favor in the presence of the one whose favor he enjoys, but in such a way that the praise may turn to the offense of his patron."
   * This sentence is long and complex. Consider simplifying the structure and clarifying the relationships between the individuals mentioned.

2. "Add that such things are commonly rumored, saying you are not expressing your own opinion, leaving the conclusion that he should look out for his own reputation, and that this very thing should be intimated - that his neighbor's reputation is in jeopardy."
   * The phrase "this very thing should be intimated" is unclear. Consider rephrasing or explaining what "this very thing" refers to.

3. "Say he is outstanding but blemished by this vice, which conceal."
   * The phrase "which conceal" is unclear. Consider clarifying what should be concealed and why.

4. "Draw him back into friendship with you, engage him in feasting, so as to render him unguarded, and have hidden witnesses before whom you say, so that he may blurt out something, either against the ruler, etc."
   * The phrase "before whom you say" is incomplete. Clarify what should be said and to whom.
   * "etc." is vague. Consider providing specific examples or removing it.

5. "Meanwhile, to appear less motivated by passion, deprecate punishment, but ineffectively, and as if from a distance hatred must be cast."
   * The phrase "as if from a distance hatred must be cast" is unclear. Consider rephrasing or explaining the intended meaning.

6. "His character and deeds must be interpreted, and when the occasion allows, he must be driven into ruin with faltering steps."
   * The phrase "driven into ruin with faltering steps" is metaphorical and may be difficult to understand. Consider using more direct language.

Overall, the passage contains several complex sentences and phrases that may be challenging for a wide audience to grasp. Simplifying the language, clarifying relationships between individuals, and providing more context for certain actions could improve readability.

### Dissolving a Friendship

Here are some passages that could be improved for better readability and clarity:

1. "When dissolving a friendship, never abruptly break it off, as if from hatred after receiving an injury."
   * Clarify what "it" refers to (presumably the friendship).
   * Consider rephrasing for clarity, e.g., "When ending a friendship, never abruptly sever ties as if driven by hatred after being wronged."

2. "So that it may gently dissolve completely, meet infrequently and, if occasion demands, briefly converse, invite to dinner, as if burdened by business, so that you do not seem to be a friend only now, when you have cast him out."
   * Break this long sentence into shorter, clearer ones.
   * Clarify the meaning of "as if burdened by business" and its relation to the rest of the sentence.

3. "If he seems to rely on the goodwill of some Patron, advise him to seek something precious from that Patron, something so dear that the Patron would never part with it."
   * Consider replacing "Patron" with a more familiar term like "benefactor" or "supporter."

4. "Thus, whether harm is done or not, the result will be the same."
   * Clarify what "the result" refers to and how it relates to the previous sentence.

5. "Let it be rumored that he lives by his friend's advice, can do nothing on his own - indeed, that his friend denies him his house, even his household."
   * Consider rephrasing the second part of the sentence for clarity, e.g., "...and that his friend even refuses him access to his house and household."

Overall, the passage would benefit from simpler sentence structures, clearer connections between ideas, and more specific references to avoid ambiguity. Breaking down longer sentences and rephrasing some parts could make the text more accessible to a wider audience.

### Praising Others

Here are a few passages that might benefit from further clarification or rephrasing for improved readability:

1. "The subject's mildness and clemency should also be excused as a debt of piety, so that his rigor may languish."
   * The meaning of "subject" is unclear in this context. Does it refer to a ruler's subjects or something else?
   * "Debt of piety" is an uncommon phrase that might confuse some readers.
   * "So that his rigor may languish" is a bit cryptic. Consider rephrasing to clarify the intended consequence.

2. "Never utter praises which, while praising one person, openly disparage others, except perhaps where there is a crowd and many confused voices."
   * The exception at the end of the sentence ("except perhaps where there is a crowd and many confused voices") is a bit ambiguous. Consider elaborating on what this exception entails and why it matters.

3. "Therefore, leave your friend's virtue unpraised and overlook his vices."
   * The use of "therefore" suggests that this statement is a conclusion drawn from the previous sentence, but the connection is not immediately clear. Consider providing a more explicit link or removing "therefore" if the connection is not essential.

Overall, the passage is relatively readable, but a few minor adjustments could help enhance clarity and comprehension for a wider audience.

### Preventing Someone from Declining a Duty

Here are some passages that could be improved for better readability and clarity:

1. "To their objection or excuse, say that you will satisfy their request when it becomes evident that you have not looked out for their best interests."
   * Clarify whose objection or excuse is being referred to.
   * The meaning of the sentence is unclear. Consider rephrasing.

2. "Leave letters to be read after a certain day of your departure, meanwhile announce his office to everyone."
   * Clarify who "his" refers to and what "his office" means.
   * The connection between the two parts of the sentence is unclear.

3. "If he writes letters back to you, do not respond to them at all."
   * Clarify who "he" refers to.

4. "If he deprecates orally, say that he is simply in that office for a short time and will soon be freed if it seems fit."
   * Clarify who "he" refers to and what "that office" means.
   * The meaning of "deprecates orally" is unclear. Consider rephrasing.

5. "Exaggerate his labors so that he can demonstrate his merits to repel the envy of others."
   * Clarify who "his" and "he" refer to.
   * The meaning of "repel the envy of others" is unclear. Consider rephrasing.

6. "Then say this office is conferred only on those who are to be promoted to greater things, whose virtue is perfect."
   * Clarify what "this office" refers to.
   * The connection between this sentence and the previous one is unclear.

To improve readability, consider providing more context, clarifying pronouns, and rephrasing sentences for better clarity and coherence.

### Controlling Anger

Here are some passages that could be improved for better readability and clarity:

1. "If in the meantime you do something out of anger, the harm will remain with you." - Clarify what "in the meantime" refers to. Suggestion: "If you act out of anger before understanding the situation, the harm will remain with you."

2. "If you are injured, it is best to dissemble, because quarreling breeds quarrels, and peace is lost." - The term "dissemble" might not be familiar to a wide audience. Suggestion: "If you are wronged, it is best to hide your true feelings, because quarreling breeds more quarrels, and peace is lost."

3. "Respond to those who restrain you in the best way possible, sometimes speaking ironically or maliciously." - Clarify who is restraining the reader and in what context. Also, the advice to respond "maliciously" seems to contradict the overall message of maintaining peace.

4. "If someone accosts you on the road, not naming you indeed, but denouncing the deed of which you are suspected, seriously accuse the same deed and the wickedness of such men as if you were in no way conscious of it." - This sentence is long and complex. Break it down into shorter, clearer sentences.

5. "If it happens that you are received by someone in an unfitting manner, dissemble and hide the enmity, and act in the same way as if you had been received honorably." - Again, "dissemble" might not be a familiar term. Suggestion: "If someone treats you poorly upon meeting, hide your true feelings and act as if you had been treated honorably."

6. "If someone rails openly against new honors, defending their cause will suit your nobility." - Clarify what "new honors" and "their cause" refer to.

7. "Have some who, at a given signal, will offer letters for these cases, and when you have read them, say that something amusing has happened, to which he may be called away by chance to witness." - This sentence is unclear and seems to lack context. Provide more information or simplify the advice.

8. "It is also customary for anger to arise if someone infallibly resolves to complete a task within a certain time, and meanwhile something occurs - beware of such resolves." - Clarify the meaning of this sentence and provide a more specific example to illustrate the point.

Overall, the translation would benefit from using simpler language, providing more context, and breaking down complex sentences into shorter, clearer ones.

### Fleeing

Here are a few passages that could be improved for better readability and clarity:

1. "Carry acid with you, like burnt wine, with which to drench your clothes stuffed with straw and suspend them."
   * Clarification needed: What is the purpose of drenching clothes with acid and suspending them?
   * Suggested fix: "Carry acid, such as burnt wine, and use it to drench clothes stuffed with straw. Suspend these clothes to create a diversion. The guard will believe you acted out of desperation and, neglecting his watch, will spread word to the others. Seize this opportunity to escape."

2. "Feign illness, such as bloody stools by eating red ochre, alter your pulse by pressing near the elbow, induce pallor."
   * Suggested fix: "Feign illness by eating red ochre to simulate bloody stools, pressing near your elbow to alter your pulse, and inducing pallor."

3. "Never inquire about only one route, but several at once, and in sight of someone, plan the escape you least intend."
   * Suggested fix: "When planning your escape, inquire about several routes simultaneously in the presence of others. However, choose the route you least intend to take."

4. "Likewise, when leaving cities and villages, first go into the fields, then change your clothing, cloak, and appearance, and return by the proposed route."
   * Clarification needed: What is the "proposed route"? Is it referring to the route the pursuers expect the escapee to take?

5. "Also, have a horse blanket with wide seams, whose color you can change at will, and a mask molded from hide, painted on both sides with different faces, so that you can assume them as you please."
   * Suggested fix: "Carry a horse blanket with wide seams that allow you to change its color as needed. Additionally, bring a mask molded from hide, painted with different faces on each side, allowing you to alter your appearance at will."

### Punishing and Correcting

Here are some passages that could be improved for clarity and readability:

1. "If someone must be well punished, and a serious case is lacking, prepare it in this way:" - The phrase "prepare it in this way" is vague. Consider rephrasing to something like, "If someone must be severely punished, but a serious offense is lacking, proceed as follows:"

2. "Young people are sometimes more inflamed by punishment; therefore, certain things should be permitted to them, but such things that satisfy their desires and do not incite them to other things (that is, they do not need anything else to obtain these, nor do they lead to similar things)." - This sentence is lengthy and confusing. Consider breaking it into two sentences and clarifying the meaning, such as, "Young people can sometimes be further provoked by punishment. Therefore, permit them certain indulgences that satisfy their desires without inciting them to pursue additional or similar activities."

3. "Administer justice liberally in another's skin where your own loss is not inflicted, as if your Governor oppressed the subjects." - The phrase "in another's skin" is unclear and the example of the Governor is confusing. Consider rephrasing to something like, "Administer justice generously when it does not result in your own loss, such as when a Governor oppresses their subjects."

4. "Let the favor to be returned remain (if the public cause so demands), so that they may attribute to themselves the repetition of their goods, at least to oblige themselves to some burden of their own accord." - This sentence is difficult to understand. Consider clarifying the meaning and simplifying the structure.

5. "In inquiring, do not act as an enemy. Dissemble when you can without harm to yourself and abstain from insults toward the well-born." - The term "well-born" may not be clear to all readers. Consider using a more widely understood term or providing a brief explanation.

6. "If you wish to lead someone back to the right path, put him in charge of correcting in others the very vice with which he himself struggles, e.g. a drunkard should exact punishment from drunkards." - The abbreviation "e.g." may not be familiar to all readers. Consider using "for example" instead.

### Quelling a Sedition

Here are a few passages that could be improved for better readability and clarity:

1. "Never allow more than one to deal with you at a time, but let them choose one from among themselves."
   * Clarify who "them" refers to. Is it the people, a group of representatives, or someone else?
   * Suggested fix: "When dealing with a group, never allow more than one person to address you at a time. Instead, let the group choose a single representative from among themselves."

2. "Philosophers inquire into the causes of an uprising; if it is due to usury, lend without interest yourself."
   * The connection between the two parts of the sentence is unclear. How does lending without interest relate to philosophers inquiring into the causes of an uprising?
   * Suggested fix: "If philosophers determine that an uprising is due to usury, consider lending without interest yourself to alleviate the situation."

3. "The instigators of the factions must be accused with false rumors of seeking hidden private gain and dominion at the expense and bloodshed of the people, and that they will gain no advantage from it."
   * The sentence is long and complex, making it difficult to follow.
   * Suggested fix: "Spread false rumors accusing the instigators of the factions of seeking hidden private gain and dominion at the expense of the people's well-being and lives. Emphasize that they will not benefit from their actions."

To improve the overall readability, consider breaking down longer sentences into shorter, more concise ones and ensuring that the connections between ideas are clear and logical.

### Hearing and Speaking Self-Praise

Here are a few passages that could be improved for better readability and clarity:

1. "Care should be taken not to let praises lead to comparisons or claims of uniqueness, even if true, because they rarely find credible belief."
   * Suggestion: "Be cautious not to let praise lead to comparisons or claims of being unique, even if true, as such statements are rarely believed."

   * Clarification needed: Who does "he" refer to in this context? The person praising or someone else?

   * Suggestion: "When you receive excessive praise, be cautious as it may be a trap. If all your actions are praised, you are thanked for everything, and you are favored above others, be highly suspicious of these flatteries."

4. "Do not say all that you can do through boasting, for you will inform your adversary."
   * Suggestion: "Avoid boasting about all your capabilities, as it will only serve to inform your adversaries."

5. "If you wish to spread your glory through books, such as those containing panegyrics, do so with a book that is easily purchased by all and esteemed in various parts of the world. And so the authors of such works should be known beforehand, and they should insert your name and praises; for these will spread your fame more than a huge volume that no one will buy or read."
   * Suggestion: "To spread your fame through books, such as those containing praise and tributes, choose a book that is affordable and well-regarded worldwide. Ensure that the authors of these works are well-known in advance and that they include your name and praises. This approach will spread your reputation more effectively than a large, expensive volume that few will purchase or read."

Suggestion: Break down the sentence and simplify the language. For example, "If something unfavorable happens, it is not always wise to hide it. Attempting to conceal the event may lead others to believe that it was even worse than it actually was."

### Acquiring Dexterity in Acting

1. "console them, as the Rhetoricians say, through commonplaces" - The term "Rhetoricians" and the concept of "commonplaces" might be unclear to a general audience. Consider simplifying or explaining these terms.

Suggestion: "When sympathizing with someone's suffering, console them using common expressions of support, without touching on anything that may offend them."

2. "neither praise nor condemn. Both are odious." - The connection between the two sentences is not immediately clear, and the term "odious" might not be familiar to all readers.

Suggestion: "If someone is disparaged in your presence, be most cautious - neither praise nor condemn the person being disparaged, as both reactions can be seen as inappropriate or unpleasant."

3. "do not allow or dissemble when another speaks ill of them" - The word "dissemble" might be unfamiliar to some readers.

   * Unclear what "stained" means in this context. Consider rephrasing or providing more context.

Overall, the text would benefit from more context, specific examples, and clearer explanations of certain terms and ideas to make it more accessible to a wider audience.

### Traveling

Here are a few passages that could be improved for clarity and readability:

1. "Deceive them as much as you can, entrust to no one which direction you are heading." - This sentence structure is a bit confusing. Consider rephrasing to: "Deceive them as much as you can, and don't tell anyone which direction you are heading."

2. "Indeed, when attacked with any taunts, dissemble." - The meaning of "dissemble" may not be clear to all readers. Consider rephrasing or providing context, such as: "If someone taunts you, hide your true feelings and remain calm."

Unless you have other information about them, they may be thieves in disguise."

4. "Do not employ the servants of the host for attendance on you, lest by this access they may spy on your bags." - The phrase "lest by this access" may be confusing. Consider rephrasing to: "Do not ask the host's servants to attend to you, as they may use this opportunity to spy on your belongings."

Overall, the translation is fairly readable, but some sentences could be simplified or clarified to improve understanding for a contemporary, wide audience.

### Not Desiring Vain Things

Here are a few passages that could be improved for clarity and readability:

1. "When dealing with a serious matter of great importance, concede the frivolous path to others, such as applause, glory, etc."
   * Clarify what "concede the frivolous path" means. Consider rephrasing, e.g., "When dealing with a serious matter of great importance, let others focus on trivial aspects like applause and glory."

2. "If an enemy wishes to surrender a city, offer the most honorable conditions: let him recognize he is not conquered, but doing a favor; let him depart with banners unfurled, and let nothing vain that a victor could wish for be lacking to him, provided that he yields the lands, hands over the captives, and leaves behind the gold and fortifications - and this when the sun sets."
   * Simplify the sentence structure and break it into smaller sentences for better readability.
   * Clarify the meaning of "when the sun sets" in this context.

3. "The same applies to matters that are valued for the subtlety or variety of the work, such as flowers, etc. Allow others to have such things as a reward, not you."
   * Provide more context or examples to illustrate the type of matters being referred to.

4. "Never premise admonitions, so that you may suffer some harm in the present from this person, as if by chance he should vow to show himself grateful to you in return. Words, and no more, are worth only as much as you should expend on words. Forgetting such things at once, your own loss always remains with you."
   * Clarify the meaning of "premise admonitions" and rephrase for better understanding.
   * Explain the connection between suffering harm and the person vowing to show gratitude.
   * Simplify the sentence "Words, and no more, are worth only as much as you should expend on words."

5. "If you are promoted to something splendid, take care also to promote one whom you fear may stir up trouble, but let him enjoy the glory of the office, not the fruit."
   * Clarify what "the fruit" of the office means in this context.

### Arguing and Correcting

Here are a few passages that could be improved for clarity and readability:

1. "That is a suitable time when the subject expects nothing but praise and comes to give thanks. Then reprove him. This is not a clever mode of arguing."
   * It's unclear what "This" refers to in the last sentence. Consider rephrasing or providing more context.
   * Suggestion: "Choosing to reprove someone when they expect praise and come to give thanks is not a clever mode of arguing."

2. "If someone is entangled in illicit loves and you wish to free him, bury him in tumultuous business."
   * The metaphorical language might be confusing for some readers. Consider rephrasing using more straightforward terms.
   * Suggestion: "If someone is involved in inappropriate romantic relationships and you wish to help them break free, keep them occupied with challenging tasks and responsibilities."

3. "Suborn some to criticize his words or deeds, report them to you, bear false witness, and approve none of his actions."
   * The term "suborn" might not be familiar to all readers. Consider using a more common word or providing a brief explanation.

4. "No less should companions of the same kind be associated with him in this - men with men, women with women, because the opposite sex has proven harmful."
   * The phrasing is a bit convoluted and might be difficult to follow. Consider simplifying the sentence structure.
   * Suggestion: "Similarly, ensure that his companions are of the same gender—men with men, women with women—as interactions with the opposite sex have proven harmful in such situations."

5. "Companions should be assigned who, if not by virtues, at least labor under contrary vices."
   * The meaning of this sentence might not be immediately clear to all readers. Consider rephrasing or providing more context.
   * Suggestion: "Assign companions who, if not virtuous themselves, at least struggle with vices that are contrary to his own."

### Simulating Affections

* "If you display affections for an extended time in public, people will eventually oppose your actions."
  * Problem: The term "affections" is vague and may not be easily understood by a contemporary audience.
  * Suggestion: "If you openly display strong emotions or personal feelings for too long, people will eventually oppose your actions."

* "Therefore, it is better to refrain from publicly displaying these emotions or behaviors and encourage others who genuinely feel the same way to follow suit."
  * Problem: The phrase "follow suit" might not be familiar to all readers.
  * Suggestion: "Therefore, it is better to refrain from publicly displaying these emotions or behaviors and encourage others who genuinely feel the same way to do the same."

* "In the meantime, it is best to focus on serious matters, so that you may forget the very affection you wish to eliminate."
  * Problem: The connection between focusing on serious matters and forgetting the affection is not clear.
  * Suggestion: "In the meantime, it is best to focus on serious matters to distract yourself from the emotions you wish to conceal."

* "By doing so, no one will be able to discern your true feelings of anger or happiness, no matter how closely they observe you."
  * Problem: The sentence is clear, but it could be more concise.
  * Suggestion: "By doing so, you will conceal your true feelings of anger or happiness from even the most attentive observers."

Rename `Reigning in emotions`?

### Avoiding Lending Money

* "Order a servant, who is handing over the items, to provide a receipt in which everything is described, to be signed as if he were taking up his own cause without your knowledge."
  * Problem: The sentence is overly complex and difficult to follow due to its length and structure.
  * Suggestion: "Instruct the servant who is delivering the items to provide a detailed receipt for everything, and have them sign it as if they were acting on their own behalf without your knowledge."

* "If you cannot avoid this situation, it may be expedient to proclaim yourself a debtor, or to simultaneously request to borrow something equivalent in return, pretending that you are in need, or that you indeed do not have an abundance of the money your friend is requesting, but that you can find it, and indeed without interest, provided that he offers collateral, or if he has things to be divided, their price will increase in the summer, if he deposits something with you."
  * Problem: This sentence is extremely long and convoluted, making it difficult for the reader to follow the main ideas. It also contains multiple clauses and conditions that are not clearly connected.
  * Suggestion: Break the sentence into smaller, more manageable parts and clarify the relationships between the various clauses and conditions. For example:
     "If you cannot avoid this situation, you may find it expedient to take one of the following actions:
     1. Declare yourself a debtor.
     2. Request to borrow something of equal value in return, pretending that you are in need.
     3. Claim that you do not have an abundance of the money your friend is requesting, but that you can obtain it without interest, provided that he offers collateral.
     4. If he has items to be divided, suggest that their price will increase in the summer if he deposits something with you."

### Arriving at the Truth

Here are some passages that may require further work to improve readability and clarity for a contemporary audience:

1. "act as if someone else were delivering your speech, or read your own deed and refer to it as pertaining to another" - This sentence is quite long and complex. Consider breaking it into two separate sentences or simplifying the structure.

2. "Thus inquire about their judgment: people form different judgments, and humanity among friends is different." - The connection between the two parts of this sentence is unclear. Clarify the meaning of "humanity among friends" and how it relates to people forming different judgments.

3. "Therefore, trust if you are modestly praised." - The term "modestly praised" might be ambiguous. Clarify what constitutes modest praise and why it should be trusted.

4. "Attributing some praise is humane; ascribing no praise, inquiring curiously about the matter, approving nothing about the deed, is inhumane." - This sentence is long and contains multiple clauses, making it difficult to follow. Consider breaking it into shorter sentences or using a list format to present the different actions and their corresponding qualities (humane or inhumane).

5. The excerpt lacks context, making it difficult for readers to understand the purpose and relevance of the advice given. Consider providing a brief introduction or context to help readers better understand the passage.

### Accusing

Here are some passages that could be improved for clarity and readability:

1. "Be the last to accuse, and do not bring a lawsuit against one whom you know to be more favored by the judge than you, unless you have first noticed the judge's mind turning to your cause." - This sentence is quite long and complex. Consider breaking it into two sentences or simplifying the structure.

2. "Approach and influence the judges with gifts; approach your adversary through mediators who may meet with him." - The meaning of "approach" in the second part of the sentence is unclear. Consider rephrasing for clarity.

3. "By no means be induced to show your rights or privileges to anyone, for you will give them something to notice and exploit." - The phrase "something to notice and exploit" is a bit vague. Consider providing a more specific explanation.

4. "If fierce, choose a time when he is in a fervor; if ignorant, one must act slowly." - The antecedent of "he" and "one" is unclear. Clarify who these pronouns refer to.

5. "Care must also be taken that the accused in no way knows that he has been accused, and in what cause, but that the accusation may come upon him suddenly, which disturbs even those well-practiced in their own cause." - This sentence is quite long and complex. Consider breaking it into shorter, more manageable sentences.

6. "And involve them in danger, showing that their case is at stake, so that they may persuade themselves that they cannot acquiesce except at their own extreme peril." - The meaning of "acquiesce" in this context may not be clear to all readers.

7. "Mix in more atrocious things from the judge's own vices, which, because they are true, will also be believed about the defendant." - The meaning of "atrocious things" and "vices" in this context is unclear. Provide more specific examples or explanations.

Overall, the passage could benefit from simpler sentence structures, clearer antecedents for pronouns, and more specific explanations for certain terms and phrases to improve readability for a wide audience.

### Being Accused

Here are some passages that I believe would benefit from further work to improve clarity and readability for a contemporary, non-specialist audience:

1. "Conceal it if you notice that you have been accused by someone, and do not suddenly correct yourself in what you were accused of, lest the informer boast that his accusation was favorably received by the one to whom he reported it."
   * This sentence is quite long and complex. Consider breaking it into two shorter sentences for clarity.
   * "Conceal it" is unclear. Specify what "it" refers to.

2. "And thus he will usually argue that if he maligns others in your presence, he will do the same to you in the presence of others, indeed, there is less prudence and harmony among those who are not allies, but rather critics of each others."

   * The sentence is lengthy and contains multiple ideas. Consider splitting it into two or more sentences.

3. "Should he find such men useful to himself, he will eventually reveal his true feelings towards such individuals."
   * "Such men" and "such individuals" are unclear. Specify who these people are.

4. "Go to the one who accused you, consult what must be done in this accusation, seek as if from an intimate friend."
   * The meaning of "seek as if from an intimate friend" is unclear. Clarify what the person should seek and how they should approach the accuser.

5. "At the onset of the dispute, expose the accuser as a co-conspirator, or have the trial conducted in his presence, particularly in matters that are agreeable, as once the accuser had to put down for the judges in the year of military service."
   * The latter part of the sentence, "as once the accuser had to put down for the judges in the year of military service," is confusing. Clarify what this means or remove it if it's not essential to the main point.

6. "This will provoke him further, you will stir him up, but initially avoid it as much as possible or do the opposite."
   * Clarify who "him" refers to.
   * The phrase "do the opposite" is ambiguous. Specify what the opposite action would be.

Overall, the translation would benefit from shorter sentences, clearer antecedents for pronouns, and more specific language to improve readability for a contemporary, non-specialist audience.

### Visiting Provinces

Here are some passages that I believe would benefit from further clarification or improvement:

1. "let no accounts be kept" - This phrase is unclear. Does it mean not to keep financial records, or not to record anything at all? Consider rephrasing for clarity.

2. "constitution of the air" - This term may not be familiar to a wide audience. Consider explaining what it means or using a more common term.

3. "the three most noble besides the others" - It's unclear what "others" refers to. Clarify or rephrase the sentence.

6. "How in every place, name, and form the manner of speaking is noted, how fruits and gardens are preserved, and caves and mines." - This sentence lacks a clear subject and verb. Rephrase it for clarity.

7. "prone to errors" - This phrase is vague. Clarify what kinds of errors one might encounter in subterranean places.

8. "Ariadne's advice" - Not all readers may be familiar with this reference. Consider explaining it briefly or using a more general term.

9. "well-fortify yourself" - This phrase is unclear. Explain what kind of fortification is needed before entering caves.

Overall, the text would benefit from shorter, clearer sentences and explanations of uncommon terms or references to make it more accessible to a wide audience.

### Reading Speculative Books

The translation seems to contain several passages that might be difficult for a contemporary, non-specialist audience to understand. Here are some suggested improvements:

1. "When reading an assertion, consider what it teaches, how many points it makes, what individual words are used and in what order, what can be inferred from it, and how the assertion is proven - by reducing the arguments to dialectical form and anticipating responses."
   * Clarify what is meant by "reducing the arguments to dialectical form."
   * Simplify the sentence structure, possibly by breaking it into shorter sentences.

2. "Apply this and judge where something is lacking, what the adversaries could deny, and what they could retort against it in turn."

4. "Do not immediately apply the conclusion to particulars, as natural philosophers apply physical causes to fire, trees, or angels, or as theologians apply, for example, what they say about the sacraments in general to the other sacraments."
   * Simplify the sentence structure and break it into shorter sentences.
   * Provide more context or explanation for the examples given (natural philosophers and theologians).

5. "And if someone explains it to you, first reread it yourself, so that you may acquire the ability to argue through each place, as the dialecticians call it, and for and against each assertion."
   * Clarify what "each place" means in this context.
   * Explain who the "dialecticians" are or rephrase the sentence to avoid the term.

6. "Finally, ask what discourse could be of use in a discussion with physicians or scholars based on this speculation."
   * Specify what "this speculation" refers to.
   * Clarify the connection between the text and discussions with physicians or scholars.

Overall, the translation would benefit from simplifying sentence structures, providing more context for specific examples, and clarifying terms that may be unfamiliar to a non-specialist audience.

## Axioms

  * Problem: The sentence lacks specificity and context.
  * Suggestion: "In any community, it is dangerous when a single individual acquires excessive power."

  * Problem: The comparison of gifts and feasting to hostile plans may be confusing without additional context.

* "Admitting a secret is more difficult than holding captive an enemy plotting against your life."
  * Problem: The comparison between admitting a secret and holding a captive enemy may not be immediately clear to readers.
  * Suggestion: "Revealing a secret can be more dangerous than imprisoning an enemy who threatens your life."

Revisit:

* `Being too sharp in action is precarious.`
* `Examine giving gifts and feasting as if they were hostile plans.`
* `Admitting a secret is more difficult than holding captive an enemy plotting against your life.`
