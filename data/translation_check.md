If you have shown yourself more difficult or less free to someone in granting some request, take care not to show yourself liberal in a similar matter, however inferior or equal, within any period of time. Otherwise, you will either excite distrust toward yourself or hatred between them.

Never increase severity toward those you govern unless you also increase favors at the same time, for you will either incur hatred or contempt. But if you increase both, you will mix love with fear.

If you begin something new that offends the eyes of others or the Prince, lead him to see the fault as an example, and the envy will be mitigated by the multitude.

If you are believed to be the author of hateful counsels, do some good things openly among the people, such as remitting tributes, punishments, etc., especially to those who are accepted by the people.

If you are planning something unusual, first meet secretly with a theologian, etc., and win him over to your side, so that they may publicly advise, promote, and even compel you to do the same.

When you are about to impose new laws, show the necessity, and deliberate with the prudent about establishing it; or at least let there be a rumor that you used their counsel, and thus you are more prudent. Then, rejecting their advice, impose other laws by your own judgment.

Do not procure a wife, maidservant, etc. for anyone, or persuade them to a certain state of life.

Beware of acting as the executor of a will.

If you are in someone's retinue while he is organizing and commanding his household, be present indeed, but do not suggest or assist with the methods. It happens that if someone comes to a new place, he may too freely extol the old ways and persons. You should be cautious in the common error.

Even if you feel the contrary, follow the more lax opinion, whether in matters of conscience or in others, yet preach the stricter one.

In the presence of no one should you show that you can do anything with superiors or have obtained a favor. Thus, in the presence of no one should you reveal your opinion about another in any confidence.

Always soothe a superior with profit, in whatever office you may be. It is better to be somewhat, or at least apparently, lax with subjects rather than strict.

If you hear that a presumed friend has spoken ill of you, do not reproach him. You will make an enemy of one who until now was indifferent.

Do not wish to know all the secrets of the great. If it happens to be divulged from elsewhere, suspicion will oppress you.

If someone is going to do something pleasing to you, e.g. congratulate, greet, etc., show that it is most pleasing to you. Otherwise, you will overturn it in the future.

If someone does not keep his word or deed as promised, do not reproach him. You will gain nothing but hatred.

As much as you can, allow yourself to be defeated by your lord in games, in which the contest is always about glory, not about any loss to you. Thus you are strong if you conquer other men, even if you are conquered by your lord alone.

In whatever familiarity you may have with your lord, never forget reverence and submission. Otherwise, he will think that familiarity breeds contempt.

Do not boast that you have won someone over to your side by your counsel, even if he was willing. He will resist more in the future.

Do not insult the bad outcome of one who did not obey your counsel. Rather, excuse the outcome in the executor.

To one boasting of his wealth, strength, dexterity in leaping, counsel, aid - do not suggest anything openly that you were (missing/unclear in Latin). If you know his ignorance, feign it. But if you have been gravely injured by a superior, not only do not complain, but do not even let him notice that you were injured, because they hate the one they have injured.

Praise even the smallest gifts as the greatest, if from your lord. Boast that you love him supremely, show it.

Refuse dignities with your whole heart, and do not let many things be conferred on you that shine greatly but bring little utility.

### Acting Cautiously

There are two parts to being a cautious man: *cautious trust*, so that while acting on guard in the presence of friends (since many friendships exist to deceive), trust no one unless you suspect them.

The other is a certain *generosity*, by which we are unwilling to indiscriminately tell the truth to anyone or correct their errors and habits. A pretense of this is indeed preferred, but it is scarcely harmless.

Entrust a secret to no one, because there is no one who cannot become an enemy after an hour.

Do nothing when distracted by life's joys, or you will err or betray yourself.

Do not assume that anyone will interpret your deed favorably; there are scarcely two such interpreters in the world.

Entrust nothing to letters that you would not want read by a third party; in fact, put his praises in them, so that they may come into his hands.

If you perceive someone wishing to extract knowledge of a matter from you and pretending to know it, do not correct him when he errs.

Either dissemble the vices of others or excuse them; close off your own affections or assume their opposites.

In however great a friendship, consider hatred; in fortune, adversity.

If you are the victor, in no case return the noblest captives to the enemy, so that if fortune turns, the enemy may have a reason to be compelled to spare you.

Indeed, also do favors for the leaders of the enemies, maintaining some correspondence with them, unless pressed by an inexcusable necessity.

Act nothing for the sake of appearances, unless you are ready to give a reason for it, because people, not waiting for it, will condemn your deeds. Such is life now that certain virtues are condemned, not to mention doubtful ones.

If inferiors and servants ask something of you, order them to leave it in writing for you, so that you may be able to inspect all the circumstances more closely. You, however, give responses only orally.

If you will converse with some where there is danger of being caught at a word, protest that you say many things in jest, even trying contraries, conniving at some things. For this reason, if something happens rather incautiously, you will be able to excuse that you protested beforehand that you sometimes say certain things in jest.

If you are pressured by games, hunting, and Venus and carried away by passions, forbid them to yourself altogether, otherwise you are about to commit many things incautiously.

With infants, the elderly, the stubborn, and those of unstable memory, and also with tyrants, act as much as possible before witnesses. Receive and request orders in writing.

Do not readily give advice to the more ferocious and impetuous; they judge by the outcome. Where it is believable that you are being observed, speak very little; there is an easy lapse in many things.

In everything, observe vices and virtues, so that if there is need, you may be able to turn to one part or the other: this will be an armory useful for many things.

Have shutters on the insides of windows, and let the part where they meet the windows be black, so that it cannot be discerned whether the window is closed or not.

### Getting Rid of an Ungrateful Guest

Matching

### Conversing with Others

Know yourself, from what background you come.

Some people's conversations are pleasing to no one at first, but gradually become sweeter, and their prudence does not immediately come forth as if from a vestibule.

Others are immediately prudent and learned, but bring a longer delay, and shamefully fail either in judgment or in consequences.

Therefore, temper your meetings in this way: If you are among the former, rarely engage in conversation, but at greater length; if among the latter, do so frequently, but briefly, where you are considered pleasing.

Be a rare guest, lest you become commonplace; in your conversations, consume the material with which you know someone to be affected, praising it. With some discuss statues, with others weapons, poetry etc.

Do not deal with him while he is distracted by other business, because then he will pay you less attention.

With the melancholic, be serious; with the choleric, be warlike; and patient, if you are inferior.

Do not affect gravity; with the learned or experienced in business, use few words and do not pile up many reasons, as on the contrary with the uneducated.

Consider the time, whether it is unsuitable; those who prevail by faction or favor, by whatever means, strive to make them your friends, intent on every occasion, premeditating, for example, if someone should constrain you with a remark in some gathering, conceive in some way a sting for pretending, responding calmly with words, and certainly persuade yourself that you will show yourself outwardly such as you have formed yourself inwardly.

If you must speak of a third party, let his name be unspoken, indeed the place, time, and all circumstances, lest perhaps the one passing by, if he should hear, may be able to guess of whom there is talk; things which are told with difficulty and are considered fictitious, even if they are most true, never utter again.

Deal reverently with all, as if they were your superiors.

Display sincerity in those things which, if divulged, will bring you no harm or praise, e.g., entrusted virtues, and not fictitious ones.

Beware of conversing with those who show themselves venal, and ready for any crime against you, because they will also be against you.

Avoid the furious and the desperate, because to deal with them is a matter full of danger.

With rulers, always be sparing of words; they prefer to be heard than to hear.

Here act the philosopher, not the orator, however familiar they may be, be reverent.

Give the first seats to the elderly, submit to their admonitions, praise and revere them, for they readily accuse.

Praise and venerate the boastful; among the uneducated, read their condition.

Be rare with the talkative, who have everything in their mouth.

Diligently praise what someone loves; censure what he hates. Acting to the contrary, even unwittingly, will offend.

When you deal with individuals, act as if you had that one as a friend, and no others.

### Controlling Anger

Do not be quick to anger at anyone, because very often you will find that the matter was reported maliciously, and you did not understand it. If in the meantime you do something out of anger, the harm will remain with you.

If you are injured, it is best to dissemble, because quarreling breeds quarrels, and peace is lost. And even if you conquer the person, this will be harsher than being conquered, and meanwhile you will stir up more opposition against yourself.

Respond to those who restrain you in the best way possible, sometimes speaking ironically or maliciously. Respond candidly to their words, not to their intention, and meanwhile pretend to be occupied with other cares.

If someone accosts you on the road, not naming you indeed, but denouncing the deed of which you are suspected, seriously accuse the same deed and the wickedness of such men as if you were in no way conscious of it. Or pretend not to understand and respond about entirely different matters.

But if he even names you, act as if he were not seriously rising up against you, but feigning anger. Then append jocular remarks that do not disparage him, but dispose him to cheerfulness, or rebuke yourself along with him as if there were some third party, and you would carp more than he would. And after they have left off, show by lighter means how futilely those things, though excellently denounced, were exaggerated, and how trivial the cause is.

If it happens that you are received by someone in an unfitting manner, dissemble and hide the enmity, and act in the same way as if you had been received honorably. Thus his rudeness will be a punishment to him and a source of confusion, and he will compensate for his error with kindness.

It will suit your nobility to defend the cause of new honors well, if someone rails openly against them. Bring forth the praises of ancient blood - let the reason be equal concerning other cases.

If you are openly assailed with abuse, so that there is no place for dissimulation, have jocular responses ready at hand, or begin some little story, which will be relevant to the matter in any case, through which, however, a way may be prepared for other discussions to follow.

Have some who, at a given signal, will offer letters for these cases, and when you have read them, say that something amusing has happened, to which he may be called away by chance to witness.

Leave time for the enemy, so that he himself may realize the unworthiness of the deed, yet do not propose it to him, lest the occasion for anger seem to arise from your side. It is also customary for anger to arise if someone infallibly resolves to complete a task within a certain time, and meanwhile something occurs - beware of such resolves.

### Fleeing

Done

### Punishing and Correcting

Do not strike with your own hand, lest you acquire cruelty. If someone must be well punished, and a serious case is lacking, it will be prepared in this way:

Punish an offense lightly, even one which you could or usually would forgive. He will take it badly and will begin to complain and grumble. When punished again, he will complain again, until as if obstinate, he will give greater cause for a greater punishment, having been found guilty of a serious offense.

Young people are sometimes more inflamed by punishment; therefore, certain things should be permitted to them, but such things that satisfy their desires, do not incite them to other things - that is, they do not need anything else to obtain these, nor do they lead to similar things.

If you have removed someone from your household, court, or office, and others take it badly, spread the rumor and openly grieve that you at last noticed he inclined you to the public detriment of your subjects, and especially of those who lament his downfall. Henceforth, their affairs will be in a better state. But to be able to suffice for all these things, to confirm them, do things that instill trust, such as if you removed a steward, take care that the wages which he was responsible for are immediately paid.

Administer justice liberally in another's skin where your own loss is not inflicted, as if your Governor oppressed the subjects. Let the favor to be returned remain (if the public cause so demands), so that they may attribute to themselves the repetition of their goods, at least to oblige themselves to some burden of their own accord.

If you wish to correct someone, deliberate with him about the remedies. He will have none more pleasing than those he himself discovers. Likewise, let him set his own punishment.

In inquiring, do not act as an enemy. Dissemble when you can without harm to yourself and abstain from insults toward the well-born. Give him letters to deliver to a certain agent of yours, other letters of recommendation; secretly issue instructions containing his punishment.

If you wish to lead someone back to the right path, put him in charge of correcting in others the very vice with which he himself struggles, e.g. a drunkard should exact punishment from drunkards.

If someone humbles himself sufficiently and publicly, spare him, lest by despair you drive him to worse, and do not compel him to that which the guilty party will most refuse. Be content with a moderate vengeance.

After a moderate punishment has been decreed, one should wait to see if perhaps a new life may arise.

When you proceed to the guilty, do not show that you have cut off the way to them, so that no one may acquire wrath by hearing their crimes unheard. Show that you were indeed born to clemency.

### Overthrowing and Deposing Wicked Men

If someone is to be deposed from office, first do not provide him with money for necessary expenses for some time, so that he contracts such debts as will suffice for punishment when he is removed from office. The debts should not be held valid, so that the creditors themselves may demand from him; thus you have punished him financially without trouble.

If the one to be deposed currently enjoys the favor of a ruler, first deposit with him a sum of money, or something which the ruler guards most carefully, or which concerns his wife most. Remove it from him secretly by night (this should be done in the manner of a joke). At the same time, the ruler should be warned to beware of treachery, and that the servant has been corrupted. All these things must be planned in advance.

If it is feared that the injured party may stir up disturbances, as when you wish to deprive a general of his office, first arrange for him to be suddenly bound, and do this so secretly that it does not appear to be happening. Finally, hand over his army to an equal, give payment to the army from your own funds, lest they miss their lost general.

If someone disputes too forcefully at the table, asserting something false, order paper to be brought so that he may write down his opinion, sign it, and dispute it tomorrow. And if you notice some proud man seeking your office, for which he is unequal (as if you are a general, for this type is especially prone to rivalry), provoke the enemy, make everything difficult, while still providing well for yourself regarding provisions for the fortress.

Ask, as if distracted by another war, that he may succeed you, and do not give him an account of the war, the places, or the enemy. Thus he will fall into difficulties, and do not hasten to his aid until he recognizes both himself and you.

If it is expedient for some youths to be completely subverted, so that they may be treated gently against their will, they will be broken by singing, painting, sculpting. Let them have desperate servants as tutors, who value nothing in honesty, who are venal in everything, who indulge the desires of youths rather than govern them.

The same holds for others, to whom you suggest such desperate servants, so that the languishing may stumble upon them. Send sluggish senators to a sluggish Senator. Through an unknown person, send responsive letters from his friend, and allow them to be lost as if through the bearer's sloth, so that they may be read by many and his affairs do not succeed.

Impose many things to be done by him at once, so that he may accomplish nothing. Persuade him to seek and ask for many things. Kill his animals, in which he delights, by guile, e.g. by providing foods seasoned with pepper or saffron, so that the animal may be rendered rabid.

Alter with drugs the horse which he is about to use, so that upon receiving the rider, it may be rendered furious. Propose immense rewards for him to enter, for instance, the lion's den - you will see him fall into an evidently dangerous situation.
